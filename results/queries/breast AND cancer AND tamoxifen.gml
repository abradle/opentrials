    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide,&#10;      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#10;      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor&#10;      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#10;      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving&#10;      chemotherapy with or without monoclonal antibody therapy before surgery may make the tumor&#10;      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these&#10;      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel, epirubicin, and&#10;      cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab works in treating women with locally advanced&#10;      breast cancer that can be removed by surgery."

    briefsummary "This phase II trial studies how well giving lapatinib ditosylate together with tamoxifen&#10;      citrate works in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it started&#10;      to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other areas of the body and did not respond to&#10;      previous treatment with tamoxifen citrate. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor&#10;      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth&#10;      of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate may fight breast cancer by&#10;      blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Sometimes when tamoxifen citrate is given,&#10;      it does not stop the growth of tumor cells. The tumor is said to be resistant to tamoxifen&#10;      citrate. Giving lapatinib ditosylate together with tamoxifen citrate may reduce drug&#10;      resistance and allow the tumor cells to be killed."

Drugs used in&#10;      chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the&#10;      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A&#10;      peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were&#10;      destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor&#10;      cells are killed. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill breast cancer&#10;      cells. Giving aldesleukin together with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells"

However, the impact&#10;      of long-term endocrine therapy on ovarian function is not established, and to our knowledge,&#10;      has never been directly studied. Understanding the effects of hormone therapy on ovarian&#10;      aging will help breast cancer patients of reproductive age make more informed and empowered&#10;      decisions regarding their treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the&#10;      relationship between tamoxifen therapy and ovarian aging. Patients will be identified&#10;      through the UCSF Cancer Registry and California Pacific Medical Center Cancer Registry and&#10;      will be evaluated based on age and menopausal status. Women who read about the study from&#10;      clinicaltrials.gov and contact the study coordinator will also be considered for enrollment.&#10;      The age of menopause onset will be assessed through surveys and will be compared to the&#10;      accepted national average age of natural menopause. Biomarkers of ovarian reserve will be&#10;      assessed in premenopausal women between ages 25-45 and will be compared to those of healthy&#10;      age- and ethnicity-matched premenopausal controls from an ongoing RO1- funded prospective&#10;      longitudinal ovarian aging (OVA) study."

    briefsummary "The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of pathologically complete&#10;      remissions achieved using a preoperative dose-intensified 8 week therapy consisting of&#10;      adriamycin and docetaxel with a preoperative sequential 24 week regimen consisting of&#10;      adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, in patients with operable carcinoma of&#10;      the breast. Secondary aims are to assess disease-free and overall survival, the rate of&#10;      complete and partial responses by palpation and imaging methods, the rate of&#10;      breast-conserving operations, and the toxicity of the two chemotherapy regimens.&#10;&#10;      Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: those with operable&#10;      breast cancer (T2-3 N0-2 M0), with the diagnosis histologically confirmed by biopsy, and&#10;      measurable disease on mammography or sonography or breast MRI (the most appropriate method&#10;      should be chosen by the investigator). After the patients have given written informed&#10;      consent, they will be randomly assigned to the study treatments. Patients in group I will&#10;      receive four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin 50 mg/m2 (15 min&#10;      i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (1 h i.v. infusion) repeated every 14 days, followed&#10;      by surgery 9-10 weeks after the start of therapy. Patients in group II will receive four&#10;      cycles of adriamycin 60 mg/m2 (15 min i.v.) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every&#10;      three weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks.&#10;      Surgery will be performed during week 25 or 26. Patients in both groups will additionally&#10;      receive oral doses of tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years, starting on the first day of&#10;      chemotherapy. Surgery will consist of removal of the remaining tumor (breast-conserving&#10;      resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection (Sentinel node biopsy is allowed if the&#10;      patient is involved in a randomized trial. Radiotherapy is applicated according to standard&#10;      proceedings of participating center. A second randomization for additional versus no&#10;      additional postoperative chemotherapy is recommended in ypN+ disease. Patients with disease&#10;      progression during preoperative therapy, chemotherapy can be stopped and surgery can be&#10;      performed immediately."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and&#10;      doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#10;      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Injecting the patient's dendritic cells directly&#10;      into the tumor may stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Radiation&#10;      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast&#10;      cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of&#10;      estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with autologous&#10;      dendritic cells before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal&#10;      tissue that needs to be removed. Giving radiation therapy and hormone therapy after surgery&#10;      may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel&#10;      together with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by autologous dendritic cells and&#10;      surgery with or without radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy works in treating women&#10;      with stage II or stage III breast cancer."

    type "trial"
    briefsummary "Background: It has been demonstrated that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than&#10;      tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, despite the excellent results, the&#10;      side effects associated with them cause between 24.5 and 31.3% therapy abandon. This study&#10;      aimed to verify the effectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping (NMT) in the treatment of myalgia&#10;      and arthralgia induced by AIs in women who have had breast cancer. Our goal is to improve&#10;      their pain, decreasing by 20% the values of their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at various&#10;      points in order to improve symptoms and increase adherence.&#10;&#10;      Methods/Design: The study includes 156 breast cancer survivors treated with endocrine&#10;      therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) from Virgen de la&#10;      Victoria Hospital (M&#195;&#161;laga, Spain) and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from such&#10;      treatment. Clinical and patient data were obtained from medical histories, genetic and&#10;      proteomic analysis, grip strength and algometry measured, questionnaires and the outcome of&#10;      interest, their VAS. NMT is applied in four possible locations, according to the symptoms of&#10;      each participant: carpal tunnel, cervical, lumbar or lumbar and cervical. There are several&#10;      more interventions before repeating the readings from the last five weeks of the start of&#10;      the study."

Secondary aims&#10;      are to assess the rate of clinical complete and partial responses, of breast-conserving&#10;      operations, and the toxicity of chemotherapy with and without tamoxifen.&#10;&#10;      Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: operable breast cancer&#10;      (T&#194;&#179;3cm N0-2 M0), histologically confirmed diagnosis by core-cut needle or incisional biopsy,&#10;      and measurable disease by mammography or sonography or breast MRI (best appropriate method&#10;      has to chosen by investigator). After the patients have given written informed consent, they&#10;      will be randomised to the study treatments. All patients are scheduled to receive 4 cycles&#10;      of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin 50 mg/m&#194;&#178; (15-min i.v. infusion) and&#10;      docetaxel 75 mg/m&#194;&#178; (1-h i.v. infusion). The patients allocated to group I additionally&#10;      receive oral doses of tamoxifen 30 mg once daily, starting on the first day of chemotherapy,&#10;      while chemotherapy alone is administered to patients of group II. Cycles should be repeated&#10;      every 14 days, followed by surgery 8 weeks after initiation of the trial. Surgery consists&#10;      of removal of the remaining tumour (breastconserving resection or mastectomy) and axillary&#10;      dissection. Patients with no response or even progression of the primary tumour can be&#10;      treated to the discretion of the investigator but should be followed up according to&#10;      protocol. If a partial or complete tumour response has been achieved, radiotherapy is given&#10;      to the remaining breast in patients undergoing breast conserving therapy, and tamoxifen&#10;      treatment is continued for a further 5 years.&#10;&#10;      Response will be assessed between the 4th cycle and surgery, using the best appropriate&#10;      method. Clinical evaluation should be performed after each cycle. It is planned to recruite&#10;      200 patients during a period of 1 year."

    briefsummary "This randomized phase III trial studies the best individual therapy for women who have&#10;      node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer by using a special test (Oncotype&#10;      DX), and whether hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy together with combination&#10;      chemotherapy is better for women who have an Oncotype DX recurrence score of 11-25. Estrogen&#10;      can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer by&#10;      blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells or by lowering the amount of estrogen the&#10;      body makes. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#10;      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#10;      spreading. Giving hormone therapy together with more than one chemotherapy drug (combination&#10;      chemotherapy) has been shown to reduce the chance of breast cancer recurrence, but the&#10;      benefit of adding chemotherapy to hormone therapy for women with node-negative,&#10;      estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer is small. New tests may provide information about&#10;      which patients are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy."

    briefsummary "Survival in young patients with cancer has increased and also have increased the adverse&#10;      long-term side effects of chemotherapy, there is a large number of women who experience loss&#10;      of ovarian function without accomplishing their reproductive desire due to gonadotoxic&#10;      treatment. The ovarian reserve determine the response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation&#10;      in fertility preservation treatments as well as in assisted reproduction techniques.&#10;      Improving this reserve by avoiding its depletion during the process could result in increase&#10;      fertility rates after cancer treatment.&#10;&#10;      Collecting follicles during tamoxifen treatment would increase the number of cryopreserved&#10;      oocytes and thus rise the potential ovarian reserve in these patients, which is reduced due&#10;      to age, chemotherapy and length of treatments.&#10;&#10;      The aim of this study is to retrieve viable mature oocytes during adjuvancy with tamoxifen&#10;      in breast cancer patients to improve the probability of subsequent pregnancy."

    briefsummary "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with the majority receiving&#10;      an endocrine therapy (ET) in the adjuvant setting. ETs dramatically reduce recurrence and&#10;      improve survival but given the aging population and increased survivorship, there are&#10;      growing concerns regarding the cognitive effects of ETs since estrogen is neuroprotective. A&#10;      critical unanswered question is whether there are differences in cognitive decline between&#10;      the two classes of ETs, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs - tamoxifen) and&#10;      aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), in older women at greater risk of hormone&#10;      receptor breast cancer and cognitive decline. Before a large multicentre observational study&#10;      can be undertaken the investigators are proposing a feasibility study to establish metrics&#10;      on participation, retention and adherence rates and parameter estimates to inform sample&#10;      size calculation required to detect cognitive differences between the two ET classes. A&#10;      convenience sample of chemotherapy-na&#195;&#175;ve patients, aged 65 and older, with early stage&#10;      disease, 25 on a SERM and 50 on an aromatase inhibitor, will be assessed cognitively at&#10;      baseline and after one year."

    briefsummary "This study will assess the usefulness of a technique called complementary deoxyribonucleic&#10;      acid (cDNA) microarray-an examination of a wide array of genes to identify&#10;      disease-associated patterns-for measuring tumor response to chemotherapy in breast cancer&#10;      patients. The study will look for &#34;markers&#34; that can help select the most effective type of&#10;      chemotherapy. It will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug combination&#10;      of capecitabine and docetaxel.&#10;&#10;      Patients age 18 years and older with stage II or III breast cancer whose tumor is 2&#10;      centimeters or larger may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be treated with&#10;      surgery, standard chemotherapy using doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide&#10;      (Cytoxan), and the capecitabine and docetaxel combination.&#10;&#10;      Patients will have a physical examination, mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging to&#10;      evaluate their tumor before beginning treatment. They will then have four 21-day treatment&#10;      cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine, as follows: docetaxel intravenously (through a vein)&#10;      on day 1 and capecitabine pills (by mouth) twice a day from days 2 through 15. No drugs will&#10;      be given from days 16 through 21. This regimen will be repeated four times, after which the&#10;      tumor will be re-evaluated by physical examination, mammogram, and magnetic resonance&#10;      imaging.&#10;&#10;      Patients will then have surgery to remove the cancer-either lumpectomy with removal of the&#10;      underarm lymph nodes; mastectomy and removal of the underarm lymph nodes; or modified&#10;      radical mastectomy. After recovery, they will have four more cycles of chemotherapy, this&#10;      time with a doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Both drugs will be given intravenously on day&#10;      1 of four 21-day cycles.&#10;&#10;      Some patients who had a mastectomy (depending on their tumor characteristics and whether&#10;      tumor cells were found in their lymph nodes) and all those who had a lumpectomy will also&#10;      have radiation therapy. Patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will also receive&#10;      tamoxifen treatment for 5 years.&#10;&#10;      In addition to the above procedures, all patients will have tumor biopsies (removal of a&#10;      small piece of tumor tissue) before beginning treatment, on day 1 of cycle 1, before cycle&#10;      2, and at the time of surgery, and physical examinations, chest X-rays, bone scans,&#10;      computerized tomography (CT) scans, electrocardiograms, multi-gated acquisition scan-MUGA&#10;      (nuclear medicine test of cardiac function) or echocardiograms of heart function, mammograms&#10;      and blood tests at various times during the study. Patients will be followed at National&#10;      Institutes of Health (NIH) for 3 years after diagnosis with physical examinations, blood&#10;      tests, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) scans.&#10;&#10;      Although it is not known whether this treatment will help an individual patient's cancer,&#10;      possible benefits are tumor shrinkage and decreased risk of disease recurrence. In addition,&#10;      the information gained about genetic changes after chemotherapy will help determine if&#10;      additional studies on the use of cDNA microarray to measure tumor response are warranted."

Acceptability of the tests and anti-cancer management based on the test results&#10;&#10;        2. Reliability and affordability of the test&#10;&#10;        3. Ability of the test to influence treatment decisions&#10;&#10;        4. Broader implications of the test, e.g., psychosocial, financial impact Study design:&#10;           Cross-sectional study, Survey Questionnaires were developed for 3 categories of&#10;           individuals:&#10;&#10;             -  Patients with early stage breast cancer&#10;&#10;             -  Healthcare professionals caring for breast cancer patients&#10;&#10;             -  Medical students /cancer researchers The questionnaires for patients and medical&#10;                students/cancer researchers are similar. The questionnaires contain a brief&#10;                section on demographic information, interest in and past experience with genetic&#10;                testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to determine if participants&#10;                will agree to BRCA1/2 testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX&#194;&#174; testing,&#10;                respectively. 18 categorical 'yes'/ 'no' questions explore reasons for their&#10;                decisions. Each scenario requires a short, hand-written response.&#10;&#10;      The questionnaire for healthcare professionals contains a brief section on demographics and&#10;      past experience with genetic testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to&#10;      determine if healthcare professionals will recommend their patients for BRCA1/2 testing,&#10;      CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX&#194;&#174; testing, respectively. 12 categorical questions explore&#10;      the reasons for their decision, and physicians are required to rank these in order of&#10;      importance.&#10;&#10;      Distribution of questionnaires:&#10;&#10;      Questionnaires will be handed out to agreeable participants on the following occasions:&#10;&#10;        1. Patients- National University Health System Cancer Centre Level 3 amp; 4 waiting areas&#10;&#10;        2. Medical students - before or after lectures, or at personal contact&#10;&#10;        3. Cancer researchers - before or after lectures, or at personal contact&#10;&#10;        4. Healthcare professionals - before or after NUHS breast tumour board, or at personal&#10;           contact Due caution will be exercised to ensure that the questionnaire is only handed&#10;           out to subjects who are aged 21 years and above.&#10;&#10;      No subject identity will be collected for these questionnaires.&#10;&#10;      Rationale and Hypothesis:&#10;&#10;      BRCA1/2 germline testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX&#194;&#174; testing have all been approved&#10;      for use in clinical practice, but controversy still exists surrounding their utility, and&#10;      apart from BRCA1/2 mutation testing in high-risk individuals, genetic tests are not&#10;      routinely performed in Singapore. BRCA1/2 germline mutation testing is performed in&#10;      individuals at high risk for hereditary cancer. CYP2D6 genotype testing predicts the benefit&#10;      of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy; poor and intermediate metabolisers of tamoxifen may have a&#10;      higher risk of breast cancer recurrence due to lower efficacy of tamoxifen because of less&#10;      efficient conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. Oncotype&#10;      DX&#194;&#174; testing is a gene-expression profiling test performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin&#10;      embedded tumour specimen, to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence and guide&#10;      decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy. Understanding the attitudes of patients and medical&#10;      professionals toward these genetic tests may help to guide medical oncologists in their&#10;      clinical recommendations and utilization of these tests in breast cancer patients."

Identifying these mechanisms is critical to&#10;      the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies that can target and overcome altered gene&#10;      networks involved in controlling breast cancer progression. While patients with tumors over&#10;      expressing HER1, 2, or 3 have been shown to have reduced survival, patients with those&#10;      tumors which overexpressed HER4 (erbB4) had increased survival (Witton 2003).&#10;&#10;      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, proof of principle trial. Selected are patients with&#10;      advanced-stage breast cancer whose tumors are ER+, tamoxifen refractory. Histologically&#10;      proven diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is advanced cancer for which there&#10;      is no treatment available which would have a reasonable chance of cure. Treatment failure is&#10;      defined as tumor progression after chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy. Patients will be&#10;      given five 30mg doses of HDAC inhibitor (LBH) over a period of two weeks. A dose will be&#10;      taken on Days 1,3,5,8 and 10. Patients will have a diagnostic tumor biopsy prior to drug&#10;      administration and a diagnostic biopsy within 48 hours (2 days) of the last dose. Primary&#10;      endpoints are measured by biopsy of palpable tumor with immunohistochemical staining for&#10;      ERBB4. Secondary end points include the evaluation of cell death, apoptosis, with&#10;      immunohistochemical staining for DNA breaks by TUNEL assay."

There will be&#10;      testing for the presence of atypia in the breast after metformin is given to see if it can&#10;      get rid of atypia. The study will compare the effects, good and/or bad, of metformin or&#10;      placebo on atypia to find out which is better.&#10;&#10;      Note: The standard drug used for the &#34;breast cancer prevention&#34; is tamoxifen. If the patient&#10;      is eligible to take tamoxifen, he/she must be offered tamoxifen prevention as part of&#10;      clinical care. Metformin and tamoxifen are not similar and function differently. This study&#10;      is not investigating the use of tamoxifen. Metformin is not approved for preventing breast&#10;      cancer, but is currently being tested to determine if it can prevent breast cancer."

    briefsummary "Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy,&#10;      surgery, and radiation therapy with or without dexrazoxane and trastuzumab in treating women&#10;      who have stage IIIA, stage IIIB or stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use&#10;      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#10;      Chemoprotective drugs, such as dexrazoxane, may protect normal cells from the side effects&#10;      of chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either&#10;      kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#10;      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known if&#10;      chemotherapy combined with surgery and radiation therapy is more effective with or without&#10;      dexrazoxane and trastuzumab in treating breast cancer"

Regimen B: two courses of CTC (tCTC) with 33% dose reduction.&#10;&#10;      Primary endpoints are:&#10;&#10;        -  Maximum degree of non-hematological toxicity.&#10;&#10;      Secondary endpoint:&#10;&#10;        -  Total number of hospital days.&#10;&#10;        -  Quality of life evaluations during and following high-dose chemotherapy (up to 1 year).&#10;&#10;        -  Effect of therapeutic dose monitoring of CTC or tCTC.&#10;&#10;      Trial design:&#10;&#10;      This investigation is a multicenter prospective randomized phase II study. Patients eligible&#10;      for the study will be identified after mastectomy or wide tumor excision with axillary&#10;      clearance. Following randomization, all patients will receive four courses of&#10;      cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil (FEC). Patients with early progressive disease&#10;      at any time will be taken off study. The first chemotherapy course must be given as soon as&#10;      possible after the surgical procedure, preferably within 3 weeks, but not later than 6 weeks&#10;      since primary surgery. After the third or fourth FEC course G-CSF is administered and&#10;      peripheral stem cells will be harvested. All radiation therapy (including radiation therapy&#10;      administered as part of a breast conserving strategy) must be postponed until all&#10;      chemotherapy has been concluded.&#10;&#10;      Questionnaires, comprising the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the Short-Form General&#10;      Health Survey (SF-36) will be sent by mail before randomization, after chemotherapy, 3&#10;      months thereafter, further on every l/2 yr till at least 1 year follow-up as performed&#10;      earlier. [6, 28, 29].&#10;&#10;      All patients will be randomized before the initiation of chemotherapy.&#10;&#10;        -  The 'standard' treatment arm will include 4 courses of FEC followed by high-dose&#10;           chemotherapy with a single course of full dose CTC followed by peripheral stem cell&#10;           reinfusion. Subsequently, conventional external beam radiotherapy to the breast or&#10;           chest wall and to the regional lymph node areas including the axilla and the&#10;           parasternal area will be administered following guidelines of the individual center.&#10;           Patients with hormone receptor positive disease will go on to receive 5 years of&#10;           tamoxifen. Patients with receptor positive disease who have not entered menopause will&#10;           be advised to undergo ovarian ablation as well.&#10;&#10;        -  The 'experimental' treatment arm will be identical to the 'standard' one, except that&#10;           the single course of CTC will be replaced by 2 courses of tCTC each followed by&#10;           peripheral stem cell reinfusion."

Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#10;      such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel work in different ways&#10;      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#10;      dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and&#10;      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Colony-stimulating factors,&#10;      such as filgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or&#10;      peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of&#10;      chemotherapy. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim together&#10;      followed by paclitaxel before surgery may be an effective treatment for breast cancer"

    briefsummary "Endocrine therapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment in patients with endocrine&#10;      responsive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are the most active agents in post-menopausal&#10;      women. Randomized comparisons either in primary/adjuvant setting or in metastatic disease&#10;      setting have demonstrated the superiority of these drugs over tamoxifen.&#10;&#10;      Primary systemic treatment administered to breast cancer patients is a useful model to&#10;      identify baseline features able to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from&#10;      cytotoxic treatment and is a way to study new biological markers in relation to the&#10;      predictive information they provide.&#10;&#10;      This treatment modality represents therefore the best way to explore new treatment&#10;      strategies in particular treatment strategies involving target therapies.&#10;&#10;      We have conducted a randomised phase II trial in which the activity of Letrozole plus/minus&#10;      oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as primary systemic treatment has been investigated in a&#10;      patient population of elderly breast cancer patients. The conclusions were that the&#10;      combination of letrozole with metronomic cyclophosphamide was a very active scheme. In&#10;      addition this was the first study demonstrating in vivo the antiangiogenic effect of&#10;      metronomic scheduling. This study suggests that chemotherapy administered on a metronomic&#10;      schedule, targeting therefore the neo-angiogenesis, could be synergistic with endocrine&#10;      therapy with aromatase inhibitors.&#10;&#10;      Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting Raf, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-alfa,&#10;      Flt-3, c-Kit, and p38.&#10;&#10;      There is a strong rationale of combining different anti-angiogenic agents. At the ASCO 2007&#10;      meeting the data of a phase I study exploring the toxicity of a combination of sorafenib and&#10;      bevacizumab have been presented. The results showed an increased toxicity being dose&#10;      limiting in some patients. To our knowledge there are no data un activity and toxicity of&#10;      adding sorafenib to metronomic chemotherapy."

    briefsummary "In 2005, the EBCIG demonstrated the efficacy of tamoxifen in improving overall survival in&#10;      hormone receptor positive breast cancers. However, tamoxifen shows partial estrogen agonist&#10;      activity, which is responsible for the drug's detrimental effects such as endometrial&#10;      carcinoma, thromboembolism, and tamoxifen resistance. More recently, aromatase inhibitors&#10;      have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The&#10;      ATAC trial demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) for 5 years of anastrozole&#10;      compared to 5 years of tamoxifen 3. The BIG 1-98 trial results demonstrated that after a&#10;      median follow-up of 25.8 months, letrozole improved DFS and distant DFS when compared to&#10;      tamoxifen. Based on these results, adjuvant hormonal therapy with Aromatase Inhibitors (AI)&#10;      has become the preferred therapy for post-menopausal woman.&#10;&#10;      However, AI therapy is also associated with toxicities that merit in-depth studies, one of&#10;      them being an increase in musculoskeletal pain. In the ATAC trial, at a median follow-up of&#10;      5.7 years, arthralgia was significantly higher (35.6% vs. 29.4%) and fractures were also&#10;      increased (11.0% vs. 7.7%) when anastrozole was administered for 5 years following surgery&#10;      with or without chemotherapy 3. The incidence of arthralgia was also significantly higher in&#10;      the MA-17 trial, with 25% of patients receiving letrozole developing arthralgia compared&#10;      with 21% in the placebo group following 5 to 6 years of tamoxifen 5.&#10;&#10;      Traditionally in cancer clinical trials, the reporting of musculoskeletal pain has been&#10;      based on the &#34;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#34;, which covers a wide range of&#10;      symptoms and does not facilitate the documentation of a pain syndrome in a specific manner.&#10;      Therefore, there is a need to design a study that will describe the nature of the pain&#10;      associated with the administration of AI therapy using tools that have been validated for&#10;      capturing a multidimensional phenomenon such as pain."

Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (which blocks an enzyme that produces&#10;      estrogen), is a drug that is FDA approved. It has been shown to reduce the risk of breast&#10;      cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have been previously&#10;      treated with tamoxifen. Letrozole works by stopping the production of estrogen in parts of&#10;      the body other than the ovaries. Leuprolide is a drug that stops a women's ovarian cycles.&#10;      This process is known as ovarian function suppression. Stopping a women's menstrual cycle&#10;      may be effective against breast cancer for some patients when given as initial therapy. The&#10;      combination of letrozole and leuprolide is considered a standard treatment for women with&#10;      metastatic breast cancer, and is also sometimes used for treatment of premenopausal early&#10;      stage breast cancer, but it has not been accepted as a standard of care treatment."

    briefsummary "This research study is evaluating a drug called Palbociclib in combination with endocrine&#10;      therapy as a possible treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.&#10;&#10;        -  Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks&#10;           activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the&#10;           body occur), called Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a&#10;           pathway, or a sequence of steps which is known to regulate cell growth. Laboratory&#10;           testing has suggested palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive&#10;           breast cancer.&#10;&#10;        -  Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking estrogen stimulation.&#10;           During this study endocrine therapy will either be tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.&#10;           It is standard of care for premenopausal women to take tamoxifen and for postmenopausal&#10;           women to take either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen after a diagnosis of hormone&#10;           receptor positive breast cancer."

It is not yet known which combination&#10;      chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different&#10;      combination chemotherapy regimens in treating women who have primary breast cancer."

Both groups of responders will be&#10;      randomized to receive either systemic consolidation therapy with high dose melphalan (180&#10;      mg/M2 total dose over 3 days) and autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by&#10;      maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy alone. Complete responders in this&#10;      noninflammatory group will not receive further therapy since, historically, they have done&#10;      well following induction and local therapy, with maintenance therapy alone.&#10;&#10;      Patients with metastatic breast cancer will be assessed for response throughout induction&#10;      therapy. Complete and convertable partial responders will receive consolidative therapy and&#10;      be randomized to ABMT followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone."

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor&#10;      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#10;      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab&#10;      may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in&#10;      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#10;      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with more than one&#10;      chemotherapy drug (combination chemotherapy), may be a better way to block tumor growth."

These side effects&#10;      compromise the patients' well being in a significant way and may favour the use of Tamoxifen&#10;      in clinical practice.&#10;&#10;      Furthermore there is evidence that polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 Gene might be associated with&#10;      an improved efficacy of Tamoxifen that is equieffective to aromatase inhibitors.&#10;&#10;      Concerning the pharmacogenetics of aromatase inhibition there are known polymorphisms of the&#10;      CYP19A1 gene that are associated with altered peripheral sex hormone levels and altered&#10;      prognosis in breast cancer patients. One study could even associate a polymorphism in the&#10;      CYP19A1 gene with a prolonged time to progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer&#10;      who have been treated with letrozol.&#10;&#10;      Therefore the aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of&#10;      an adjuvant Letrozol treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients."

    briefsummary "This will be a proof of principle clinical trial to evaluate the use of pasireotide (SOM230)&#10;      in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Surgery and radiotherapy are&#10;      used as treatment for DCIS and subsequent treatment with antiestrogens has been effective in&#10;      reducing the occurrence of invasive breast cancer. Unfortunately, treatment with&#10;      antiestrogens carries potential serious side effects and toxicities that are intolerable to&#10;      some patients. Preliminary data suggest that inhibition of IGF-1 action in the breast will&#10;      be at least as effective as tamoxifen. Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog that prevents&#10;      mammary development by inhibiting IGF-1 action directly in the mammary gland and also&#10;      indirectly without causing menopausal symptoms. This study is an expansion of work that we&#10;      have previously done in women with atypical hyperplasia of the breast, which showed that&#10;      treatment with pasireotide for 10 days caused a reduction in the cellularity of these&#10;      precancerous lesions. In our present study, women with DCIS will be treated with pasireotide&#10;      for 20 days prior to surgical excision. Endpoints will be as follows:&#10;&#10;        1. To determine whether pasireotide will inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis&#10;           (signs of tumor growth), and stimulate apoptosis (cell death) in surgically excised&#10;           tissue in comparison to core biopsies from women with estrogen receptor (ER) positive&#10;           DCIS. Both the core biopsy and surgical excision are standard of care procedures that&#10;           women with DCIS have regardless of participation in this trial.&#10;&#10;        2. To use dynamic contrast enhanced MRI to assess patients before and after treatment with&#10;           pasireotide and evaluate for changes in tumor volume and other tumor related features&#10;&#10;        3. In our previous study we found that many women experienced a slight elevation in blood&#10;           sugar with 10 days of treatment with pasireotide. Other work has shown that this effect&#10;           often resolves with greater duration of treatment. We are therefore expanding the&#10;           duration of treatment in this study to 20 days to assess if the initial hyperglycemia&#10;           seen with pasireotide improves as treatment duration progresses."

    briefsummary "1. The primary objective of the MINDACT trial is to demonstrate the superiority of the molecular profiling approach over the usual clinical assessment in assigning adequate risk categories (and the need to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or not) to to breast cancer patients with 0 to 3 positive nodes 2. The trial will also aim to compare a docetaxel-capecitabine regimen possibly associated with increased efficacy and reduced long-term toxicities to existing commonly used anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens (anthracyclines followed by docetaxel for node positive).  3. Finally to determine the best endocrine treatment strategy i.e. single agent up-front, aromatase inhibitor (AI) (letrozole) for seven years compared to the sequential endocrine strategy of 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 5 years of letrozole."

Since ATAC&#10;      was a nationwide study, the women of LATTE will also reside and receive their follow-up care&#10;      in various areas of the country. There will not be any vulnerable groups participating in&#10;      this study.&#10;&#10;      Patient interaction will consist on in person interviews at designated follow-up times&#10;      and/or telephone interviews. Data will be collected at point of contact, whether that is in&#10;      person at the clinic site or over the telephone. Telephone interviews will be completed in&#10;      LATTE study offices. Topics of focus for data collection consists of: whether or not there&#10;      is a suspected recurrence, new breast primary tumour, new other primary tumour, ischaemic&#10;      cardiac event, cerebrovascular event, or a serious fracture. Since the follow-up questions&#10;      are short in detail, respondent burden time should be less than 1 hour in most cases."

    briefsummary "One of the basic principles of cancer chemotherapy is that these drugs act exclusively or&#10;      mainly on cells in cycle. Estrogens have been shown to increase the fraction of breast&#10;      cancer cells in cycle. Tamoxifen on the other hand, decreases the proliferative fraction and&#10;      has been shown to negatively impact on the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer&#10;      when given concomitantly. A number of previous studies have attempted estrogenic recruitment&#10;      of cancer cells (into cell cycle) to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in locally&#10;      advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Although some studies showed an increase in response&#10;      rates in the recruitment arm, there was no benefit in time to progression or survival in any&#10;      of the studies. These results may have been due to the inadequate sample size of the studies&#10;      and advanced stage disease (with presumably higher fraction of inherently chemoresistant&#10;      cells). The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that estrogenic recruitment of&#10;      micrometastatic disease in operable breast cancer will increase the efficacy of standard&#10;      adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. The intervention arm of the study will involve&#10;      administration of short duration estrogen prior to each cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. The&#10;      end-points are disease free and overall survival."

    briefsummary "The sequential administration of endocrine therapies to patients with advanced breast cancer&#10;      requires the availability of therapies with different modes of actions, so that tumours&#10;      developing resistance to one agent are not cross resistant to another. Because of its&#10;      mechanism of action, fulvestrant is distinct from other hormonal therapies, which therefore&#10;      limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other therapies such as tamoxifen and the&#10;      aromatase inhibitors (AIs)&#10;&#10;        -  In this way, patients may benefit from an extended period of endocrine treatment, which&#10;           has considerable tolerability and quality-of-life advantages over cytotoxic&#10;           chemotherapy.&#10;&#10;        -  In Belgium, fulvestrant is indicated for treating postmenopausal women with hormone&#10;           receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with recurrence during&#10;           or after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression during anti-oestrogen&#10;           treatment. However, little information is currently available on how fulvestrant is&#10;           actually being used by physicians in Belgium. The optimum sequence of endocrine&#10;           treatment for advanced breast cancer has yet to be defined and may depend on certain&#10;           patient or disease characteristics.&#10;&#10;      Fulvestrant has been granted reimbursement by the Belgian Health authorities (RIZIV/INAMI)&#10;      with the recommendation to collect the real life data necessary to assess the patients'&#10;      breast cancer treatment history that may influence the actual endocrine treatment sequence&#10;      according to physicians current clinical practice.."

With adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy&#10;      (WBRT) the local relapse rate drops to under 1% after 5 years under Tamoxifen (4).&#10;&#10;      It has been demonstrated (6, 9, 10) that the efficacy of radiation of the tumor bed only in&#10;      a selected group can be non-inferior to WBRT.&#10;&#10;      The TARGIT C study should confirm the efficacy of a single dose of intraoperative&#10;      radiotherapy (IORT) in a well selected group of patients with small breast cancer and&#10;      absence of risk factors. In presence of risk factors postoperative WBRT will be added to&#10;      complete the radiotherapeutic treatment according to international guidelines.&#10;&#10;      Endpoints are the local relapse rate (within 2 cm of the tumor bed), ipsilateral relapse,&#10;      cancer-specific and overall survival and contralateral breast cancer as well as&#10;      documentation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome.&#10;&#10;      The expected local relapse rates are 0.825/1.375% after 3/5 years, respectively.&#10;      Discontinuation of the trial is scheduled if rates of local relapse rates rise to&#10;      1.55/2.4/4% after 1/3/5 years. Power calculations result in 387 patients with a calculated&#10;      dropout and loss to follow-up rate of 10%, an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.10. There will&#10;      be only a pre-pathology stratum.&#10;&#10;      It is a pragmatic trial in which each participating centre has the option to modify entry&#10;      criteria and criteria for WBRT according to this core protocol after consultation with the&#10;      steering committee and local ethics committee (e.g. size, free margins). Only centers with&#10;      access to the Intrabeam&#194;&#174; system (Carl Zeiss) can recruit patients into the trial."

The trial is designed to compare the effectiveness&#10;      between docetaxel plus epirubicin, and docetaxel plus epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide as&#10;      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable premenopausal breast cancer patients, and also to&#10;      compare the outcomes associated with chemo-induced amenorrhea between the two neoadjuvant&#10;      chemotherapies. The investigators will randomly assign 600 premenopausal female patients&#10;      with operable breast cancer to receive four cycles of docetaxel and epirubicin (TE); or four&#10;      cycles of docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TEC). After every two cycles of&#10;      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the investigators will estimate the effectiveness of therapy.&#10;      Patients will undergo modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery after four&#10;      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and then receive postoperative chemotherapy (two&#10;      cycles), radiation therapy, herceptin targeted therapy or hormone therapy according to the&#10;      NCCN (2011) guideline. The follow-up will be ten years after surgeries. The primary aim is&#10;      to examine whether the docetaxel and epirubicin (TE) will be as effective as the docetaxel,&#10;      epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TEC) (pCR rate, cCR rate, PR rate, SD rate,&#10;      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)). The secondary aim is to&#10;      correlate chemo (TE/TEC)-induced amenorrhea with outcomes in premenopausal women."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#10;      triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of&#10;      estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more&#10;      effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how&#10;      well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with&#10;      hormone-responsive breast cancer."

    briefsummary "The main objective of our project is to further characterize the deregulation of CE&#10;      (Cholesterol Epoxides) metabolism in different moleculars subtypes of BC (BC=Breast Cancer)&#10;      (luminal A and B, HER2+ and triple negative). We will study not only the level of expression&#10;      of the enzymes involved in this pathway by immuno-histochemistry, all the enzymes involved&#10;      were identified in our preclinical work (GSTA1 (Glutathione S-Transferase A1 ), DHCR7,&#10;      D8D7I, 11&#206;&#178;HSD2 (11&#206;&#178;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of type 2 )), but also the metabolite rates&#10;      of CE (hydrolyses cholesterols-5,6-epoxide ), CT (into cholestane-3&#206;&#178;, 5&#206;&#177;, 6&#206;&#178; triol ), DDA&#10;      (Dendrogenin A)and OCDO (6-oxo-cholestan-3&#206;&#178;, 5&#206;&#177;-diol ). Our preliminary results demonstrate&#10;      the feasibility of these dosages. We will also establish whether these deregulations are i)&#10;      correlated with different histo-prognostic parameters (pN (N= Node), pT (T= Tumor) , EV,&#10;      TIL&#226;&#128;&#166;) but also clinical ii) an independent prognostic parameter of BC in terms of&#10;      disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. The cohort consists of&#10;      350 cases of BC, treated between 2009 and 2011 as well as all relevant clinical&#10;      informations. In parallel, we will continue our preclinical work by characterizing the&#10;      targets and mechanisms of action of OCDO. Our preliminary results indicate that OCDO is a&#10;      modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which could be target to inhibit this&#10;      pathway. On the other hand, we will characterize in the same manner as in human tumors, the&#10;      deregulations of the CE metabolism in vitro and in vivo (including xenografts in mice of&#10;      human tumors, in collaboration with Roman-Roman S) on a representative panel of BC molecular&#10;      subtypes, sensitive or not usually administered in clinical treatment and study the&#10;      anti-tumor effect of various &#34;anti-OCDO&#34; therapies (therapies preventing its production such&#10;      as Tam (tamoxifen) or DDA, inhibitor of the enzyme producing OCDO, or an inhibitor of the GR&#10;      (glucocorticoid receptor )), alone or in combination with conventional therapies"

    briefsummary "Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) are effective for secondary prevention of breast cancer and may&#10;      soon replace tamoxifen as first-line therapy in the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast&#10;      cancer. However, because these medications produce a marked reduction in serum estrogen&#10;      levels, this is likely to result in an increased rate of bone loss and risk of developing&#10;      osteoporosis and fractures in postmenopausal women treated with these agents. Indeed,&#10;      substantial bone loss has been reported in several large clinical trials of AIs.&#10;      Osteoporosis drugs are available that could prevent this loss, but they have frequent side&#10;      effects and are expensive. Thus, treating all women receiving AIs might not be the most&#10;      appropriate and cost-effective approach. A better approach might be to select women at&#10;      highest risk of bone loss and only treat them with antiresorptive agents.&#10;&#10;      The proposed pilot study will evaluate women who receive anastrozole or letrozole therapy,&#10;      are receiving adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D and have baseline normal or&#10;      moderately low bone mass in order to determine if early changes in bone turnover markers&#10;      correlate with bone loss at one year. If data from this pilot protocol support our&#10;      hypothesis, then we would propose a larger trial to confirm it. The ultimate aim is to&#10;      predict which women are at higher risk of bone loss and therefore treat them earlier with&#10;      bone-sparing agents, while those with lower risk could be monitored on conservative therapy."

Estradiol is the most potent of the naturally occurring&#10;      estrogens, and can be administered to treat menopausal symptoms and also sometimes to treat&#10;      metastatic breast cancer. The investigators propose to study patients with biopsy-proven&#10;      newly diagnosed, locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer who are going to&#10;      be treated with endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifen,aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as&#10;      standard of care therapy.&#10;&#10;      Subjects will undergo a total of two FFNP-PET/CT scans; one before and a second one&#10;      immediately following the one day estradiol challenge before the start of standard of care&#10;      ET. The estradiol challenge will consist of administering a total of 6 mg of estradiol&#10;      orally (three doses of 2 mg each) given at approximately 8 hour intervals and over a 24 hour&#10;      period."

    sourceid "nct"
    type "trial"
    briefsummary "About a third of patients with breast cancer are usually treated by hormone pills called&#10;      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone&#10;      production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast&#10;      cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and&#10;      has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However, hormone pills usually work for&#10;      about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on, breast cancer will start to grow again. This&#10;      condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called &#34;endocrine&#10;      resistant&#34; breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how&#10;      these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests, the&#10;      investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make&#10;      letrozole work again. However, it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in&#10;      humans.&#10;&#10;      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole, lapatinib,&#10;      and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work.&#10;&#10;      Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug&#10;      Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of&#10;      breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast&#10;      cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also&#10;      include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these&#10;      patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is&#10;      considered experimental.&#10;&#10;      Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer.&#10;      Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that&#10;      everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental&#10;      in this study."

An excisional biopsy&#10;      of the primary tumor is acceptable, but without definitive local therapy or prior&#10;      chemotherapy. Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are&#10;      prospectively randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil,&#10;      adriamycin, leucovorin, cytoxan, granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF])&#10;      chemotherapy either before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy.&#10;      Chemotherapy is given as an outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy,&#10;      local therapy (modified radical mastectomy, or breast segmentectomy/axillary&#10;      dissection/breast radiotherapy according to patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after&#10;      last chemotherapy. For patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy, chemotherapy will&#10;      begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable.&#10;      Upon completion of local therapy and chemotherapy in either treatment group, all estrogen&#10;      receptor positive patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and&#10;      physical examination each 3 months for first 3 years, each six months for years 4 and 5, and&#10;      yearly thereafter. Mammogram, bone scan, chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly."

    briefsummary "Lifestyle behaviors among women with a family history of breast cancer are likely to be&#10;      influenced by a number of factors, including both objective risk factors and subjective&#10;      risk, or perceived risk. The aims of this mixed method study are twofold and will be&#10;      explored through both quantitative (i.e. secondary survey data) and qualitative data (i.e.&#10;      personal in-depth interviews) derived from the Sister Study, a large epidemiologic study&#10;      being conducted through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which is&#10;      addressing risk factors for breast cancer in sisters of women who have had breast cancer.&#10;      The quantitative aims include an exploration of lifestyle behaviors and behavioral&#10;      differences between White and African American women, as well as well as an exploration of&#10;      the relationships between lifestyle behaviors (i.e. varying levels of objective risk based&#10;      on Gail model risk scores, medical risk-reducing factors (i.e. use of Tamoxifen or&#10;      Raloxifene and/or prophylactic surgery), as well as additional factors that may be&#10;      contributors to perceived risk. This aim will be addressed using data that have already been&#10;      collected as part of the baseline activities for the Sister Study. The primary qualitative&#10;      aim is to gain a better understanding about perceived risk and the relationship between&#10;      perceived risk and lifestyle behaviors in both White and African American women with a&#10;      family history of breast cancer. This aim requires the collection of new data through&#10;      in-person interviews with between 28 and 40 women, depending on how many interviews are&#10;      required to achieve &#34;data saturation.&#34;&#10;&#10;      The mixed method approach will be based on a &#34;complementarity&#34; model, which emphasizes the&#10;      use of two different methods to address different aspects of the research problem. Results&#10;      from both methods will become integrated into the discussion of the findings and it is&#10;      expected that this approach will enrich the study and allow for elaboration of the&#10;      quantitative results. The secondary data analysis will be derived from approximately 10,000&#10;      women, initially enrolled in the Sister Study, who are between the ages of 35 and 74 and&#10;      have had at least one sister affected by breast cancer.

    briefsummary "Background:&#10;&#10;        -  Some types of cancer cells that have hormone receptors on their surfaces need the&#10;           hormone estrogen to grow. The drug tamoxifen blocks estrogen from binding to the tumor&#10;           cells, which helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer. Tamoxifen has been approved&#10;           for treatment of certain types of estrogen-linked cancers, such as breast and ovarian&#10;           cancer.&#10;&#10;        -  The experimental drug Z-Endoxifen HCl (endoxifen) is related to tamoxifen, and has been&#10;           shown to work against similar estrogen-linked cancers. In many cancer patients,&#10;           tamoxifen is turned into endoxifen by enzymes in the liver; however, not all people&#10;           have the liver enzymes that can turn tamoxifen into endoxifen, which means that the&#10;           drug cannot work properly. Taking certain other drugs at the same time as tamoxifen can&#10;           also keep it from turning into endoxifen. Researchers are interested in determining&#10;           whether endoxifen tablets are effective in slowing or stopping tumor growth in&#10;           individuals whose hormone-linked tumors have not responded to standard treatment.&#10;&#10;      Objectives:&#10;&#10;      - To test the safety and effectiveness of daily endoxifen in individuals with hormone&#10;      receptor positive solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.&#10;&#10;      Eligibility:&#10;&#10;      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hormone receptor&#10;      positive solid tumors (breast or other tumors), desmoid tumors, or gynecologic tumors that&#10;      have not responded to standard treatment.&#10;&#10;      Individuals with breast cancer must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and one&#10;      prior hormonal regimen for metastatic disease.&#10;&#10;      Design:&#10;&#10;        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history (including prior hormone use)&#10;           and physical examination, as well as blood and urine tests, tumor imaging studies, and&#10;           an eye examination.&#10;&#10;        -  Participants will take endoxifen tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment, and will&#10;           be asked to keep a medication diary to record any side effects.&#10;&#10;        -  Participants will have regular clinic visits with blood and urine samples and imaging&#10;           studies to evaluate the cancer's response to treatment.&#10;&#10;        -  Participants will continue to take endoxifen for as long as the cancer responds to the&#10;           treatment."

    briefsummary "Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer is typically treated with adjuvant&#10;      endocrine therapy in order to decrease risk of breast cancer recurrence and to improve&#10;      overall survival from the disease. Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and&#10;      the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitor therapy is&#10;      increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities&#10;      compared to tamoxifen. However, aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of&#10;      patients, which can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation&#10;      in a minority of cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains&#10;      unclear, and predictors of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. Initial reports&#10;      suggest that grip strength decreases during aromatase inhibitor therapy, and that body-mass&#10;      index may influence development of this symptom. Therefore, this longitudinal study has been&#10;      developed to determine change in grip strength over time in women treated with aromatase&#10;      inhibitors and tamoxifen, as well as to identify potential associations between change in&#10;      grip strength and BMI. Patient self-reported symptoms will also be collected. A total of 115&#10;      women with early stage breast cancer who are initiating therapy with either an aromatase&#10;      inhibitor or tamoxifen will be enrolled."

In patients expressing hormone receptors, it was shown&#10;      that hormone therapy administered in maintenance after induction chemotherapy, could have a&#10;      benefit regarding the progression-free survival. The investigators make the hypothesis that&#10;      there would be interest to discontinue treatment with taxane after 4 months, and to begin&#10;      hormone therapy while continuing maintenance bevacizumab.&#10;&#10;      Exemestane was chosen because it has been shown potentially active in patients who&#10;      progressed after letrozole, anastrozole or tamoxifen."

    briefsummary "Women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer are typically treated with hormone&#10;      therapy as part of their treatment after surgery. In the past few years it has been found&#10;      that treatment with aromatase inhibitors is superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women.&#10;      Tamoxifen is still used for premenopausal women, however, because aromatase inhibitors are&#10;      not effective in women who have functioning ovaries. Some women are premenopausal at the&#10;      time they are diagnosed with breast cancer, but then stop having menstrual periods when they&#10;      are treated with chemotherapy. It is unclear if these women can also be treated safely with&#10;      aromatase inhibitors.&#10;&#10;      In this clinical trial the researchers will try to answer this question. Women with hormone&#10;      receptor positive breast cancer who become postmenopausal with chemotherapy will be invited&#10;      to participate in this study. Each woman will be treated with one of the aromatase&#10;      inhibitors, anastrozole (Arimidex), and then carefully monitored to ensure that her ovaries&#10;      do not start making estrogen. If her estrogen level remains low, then she will continued to&#10;      be followed for 18 months. If the level increases to the level typically seen in&#10;      premenopausal women, however, then she will stop taking part in this study.&#10;&#10;      The study will also evaluate multiple factors that may help doctors predict who will&#10;      tolerate the therapy without having their ovaries start making estrogen again. Some of the&#10;      factors to be evaluated include other hormone levels (blood tests) as well as family history&#10;      of early menopause (mother, sisters). In addition, changes in certain genes that affect how&#10;      patients' bodies handle chemotherapy drugs will be tested to see if they affect whether or&#10;      not patients recover ovarian function. Overall, the purpose of the study is to determine&#10;      which patients who become postmenopausal from chemotherapy are likely to tolerate aromatase&#10;      inhibitor treatment safely, and how often the patients' ovarian function needs to be tested&#10;      during treatment."

    briefsummary "Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive endocrine therapy (e.g. tamoxifen) and/or&#10;      chemotherapy are at risk for experiencing premature menopause because of their treatment.&#10;      The resulting symptoms, most notably hot flashes, can cause significant detriment to a&#10;      patient's quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of&#10;      hormone replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase&#10;      risk of tumor recurrence. In addition, many medical oncologists feel it is contraindicated&#10;      in this population, especially among women whose breast cancers have estrogen receptors.&#10;      This has lead to an increased interest in options other than estrogen replacement in the&#10;      treatment of hot flashes, though most investigations of alternative medications have shown a&#10;      suboptimal response.&#10;&#10;      Recent studies have suggested that non-drug treatments using alternative or complementary&#10;      therapies may be effective. Specifically, hypnosis has been promoted as a means to control&#10;      hot flashes, though it has not been tested in a randomized fashion. In accordance with the&#10;      National Cancer Institute's recent initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials to&#10;      include symptom management studies, our purpose is to evaluate the role of complementary and&#10;      alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. Specifically,&#10;      we plan to evaluate the use of hypnotherapy for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes&#10;      in breast cancer survivors. We intend to recruit 60 women into a pilot feasibility trial&#10;      comparing hypnotherapy to the drug gabapentin (Neurontin&#194;&#174;) for the treatment of&#10;      therapy-induced hot flashes in eligible women who are receiving care at the Breast Health&#10;      Center. We have chosen gabapentin based on recent studies showing it may be an effective&#10;      non-estrogen treatment for this indication.&#10;&#10;      We will identify patients who are experiencing at least one daily hot flash as a result of&#10;      the treatment they received for their breast cancer for participation. When enrolled, they&#10;      will be randomized into either the treatment arm, in which they will receive daily&#10;      gabapentin, or the experimental arm, in which they will undergo weekly hypnotherapy.&#10;&#10;      Our study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the&#10;      control of hot flashes in this population."

    briefsummary "Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist with no agonist effects, which binds, blocks and degrades&#10;      the ER. Fulvestrant is comparable to third-generation aromatase inhibitors in terms of&#10;      efficacy and tolerability for patients who have progressed on prior tamoxifen therapy and&#10;      past studies have found all three-third-generation AIs to be at least as good as tamoxifen&#10;      in first-line metastatic therapy in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant has been studied&#10;      little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions. The clinical&#10;      effectiveness of fulvestrant as a treatment for advanced breast cancer has previously been&#10;      demonstrated at the standard dose (AD; 250 mg/mo) in several phase III clinical trials in&#10;      postmenopausal women. However, there is evidence to suggest that doses of fulvestrant higher&#10;      than 250 mg may have greater pharmacodynamic activity against the ER pathway. Moreover,&#10;      dose-dependent clinical activity has been observed for fulvestrant. The activity of a&#10;      fulvestrant high-dose (HD; 500 mg/mo) regimen has been investigated in two recent studies. A&#10;      pilot Japanese study showed fulvestrant HD to have clinical activity in the treatment of&#10;      advanced or recurrent breast cancer, to be well tolerated, and to result in plasma levels&#10;      approximately double those seen with fulvestrant low-dose. Subsequently, a neoadjuvant study&#10;      comparing fulvestrant low-dose and high-dose reported that significantly greater Ki67 and ER&#10;      downregulation was achieved with the high-dose compared with the low-dose regimen and that&#10;      both doses were well tolerated. A recent randomized trial also showed superior outcome of&#10;      high-dose fulvestrant than AI.&#10;&#10;      Based on this rationale, we introduced high-dose fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a&#10;      randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist and LHRH alone in premenopausal&#10;      metastatic breast cancer patients who failed to tamoxifen treatment."

    briefsummary "Aromatase inhibitors are the most effective adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy for estrogen&#10;      receptor positive (ER+) post-menopausal breast cancer patients, with proven superiority over&#10;      tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival, time to recurrence, and contralateral breast&#10;      cancer. However, approximately half of the women who take this drug will develop significant&#10;      joint pains, termed Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia (AIA). Though this medicine&#10;      should be taken for 5 years, the joint pain can be so troublesome that up to 13% may&#10;      prematurely discontinue it because of the arthralgia, thus sacrificing their best chance of&#10;      recurrence-free survival. Nonetheless, neither the etiology nor optimal management of AIA is&#10;      clearly understood, leaving both doctor and patient rather frustrated.&#10;&#10;      The investigators therefore propose to test the hypothesis that AIA can be effectively&#10;      treated by a new clinical algorithm, and that effective treatment of the problem will lead&#10;      to improved compliance with Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) therapy. The algorithm is a clinical&#10;      pathway for treating AIA which incorporates, in a rational and step-wise manner, a series of&#10;      interventions based on the available evidence. Interventions include acupuncture, pain&#10;      medication, weight bearing exercise, and other commonly used therapies for AIA.&#10;&#10;      The investigators will enroll 100 women who are beginning adjuvant AI therapy and assess&#10;      each woman's baseline joint pains via a questionnaire as well as grip strength measurement.&#10;      The investigators will then periodically repeat these tests during AI therapy in order to&#10;      systematically quantify and characterize AIA. Those women who develop AIA during the course&#10;      of the study will be placed on the clinical algorithm, and the investigators will observe&#10;      whether their joint pains significantly improve (as measured by questionnaire and grip&#10;      strength measurement) after institution of the algorithm. The investigators will also&#10;      determine whether their compliance is improved compared to historical controls, and at least&#10;      non-inferior to the women in the study who do not develop AIA. Finally, the investigators&#10;      will measure serum estrogen level at baseline and then periodically during AI therapy to&#10;      investigate whether more dramatic decline in estrogen level after initiation of an AI leads&#10;      to significant AIA and earlier time to onset.&#10;&#10;      This study targets a very common cause of pain among breast cancer survivors and aims to&#10;      offer an effective treatment strategy to alleviate pain and improve quality of life as well&#10;      as medication compliance."

Patients will be randomized to:&#10;&#10;        -  FAC x 6 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide&#10;           500 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 6 cycles.&#10;&#10;        -  FAC x 4 (cycles) &#226;&#134;&#146; Taxol&#194;&#174; x 8 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2&#10;           + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles, followed by 8&#10;           administrations of weekly paclitaxel 100 mg/m2&#10;&#10;      Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors must receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily&#10;      for 5 years, after the end of chemotherapy.&#10;&#10;      Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors are allowed to receive aromatase&#10;      inhibitors as initial adjuvant hormone therapy or after tamoxifen.&#10;&#10;      All patients with breast conservative surgery must receive radiotherapy.&#10;&#10;      Estimated 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm (FAC x 6) is expected to be 80%.&#10;      It is expected that disease-free survival will increase by 5% in the experimental arm&#10;      (FAC-paclitaxel). 906 patients per arm must be recruited, to detect this difference with an&#10;      alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power. Assuming a 6% post-randomization drop-out rate, 960&#10;      patients per arm are needed, 1920 in total."

    briefsummary "It has been found that many breast cancers are hormone dependent and that hormonal therapy&#10;      by estrogen suppression such as ovarian ablation, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor has&#10;      proven beneficial in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Zoladex, a kind of luitinizing&#10;      hormone releasing hormone analogue, can offer efficient estrogen suppression as well. It can&#10;      induce reversible amenorrhea and the clinical effect is similar to ovarian ablation. Some&#10;      studies have demonstrated the efficacy of zoladex in treating pre and perimenopausal hormone&#10;      dependent breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Few data is available on&#10;      Zoladex in neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer In our departments, neoadjuvant CEF&#10;      regimen is of general practice, and a preliminary study is designed to investigate whether&#10;      adding Zoladex into neoadjuvant CEF could further improve results in hormone responsive&#10;      breast cancer."

    briefsummary "This is a phase II trial to assess whether IRESSA&#226;&#132;&#162; (gefitinib) has anti-tumour efficacy in&#10;      patients with breast cancer. The trial proposes to enter 27 patients who have acquired&#10;      resistance to tamoxifen and 27 patients with ER negative tumours. However for each of these&#10;      two types of patients recruitment will stop after 14 patients have been entered in order to&#10;      confirm that IRESSA&#226;&#132;&#162; (gefitinib)has anti-tumour efficacy. If no patient out of 14 in a group&#10;      has shown clinical benefit (ie an objective response (CR or PR) or stable disease (SD) for&#10;      at least 24 weeks) then a clinical benefit rate of >20% can be ruled out with >95%&#10;      certainty. If one or more of the objective response or stable disease (> 24 weeks) has been&#10;      seen in the first 14 patients recruited in a group then recruitment to that group will&#10;      recommence to a total of 27 patients. If 14 patients are entered into an arm but not all 14&#10;      patients are available for final analysis and the toxicity/safety and tolerability profile&#10;      of the therapy is acceptable and documented and a clinical benefit is seen in the patients,&#10;      enrolment of additional patients beyond the initial 14 may be made based on overall clinical&#10;      assessment."

    briefsummary "Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer is typically treated with adjuvant&#10;      endocrine therapy in order to decrease risk of breast cancer recurrence and to improve&#10;      overall survival from the disease. Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and&#10;      the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitor therapy is&#10;      increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities&#10;      compared to tamoxifen. However, aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of&#10;      patients, which can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation&#10;      in a minority of cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains&#10;      unclear, and predictors of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. This&#10;      observational study is designed to collect patient-reported outcomes and serial serum&#10;      samples in order to investigate potential etiologies of this bothersome toxicity."

    briefsummary "Many women with breast cancer now live for decades after their breast cancer treatment. In&#10;      view of this, modern breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy for breast cancer aims&#10;      to reproduce as natural a breast shape as possible. Keeping a natural breast appearance has&#10;      been shown to be very important to a woman's emotional and psychological recovery.&#10;&#10;      Breast cancer treatment often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#10;      anticancer tablets such as Tamoxifen, and newer targeted drugs such as Herceptin.&#10;      Radiotherapy is usually given after surgery. However, radiotherapy after mastectomy and&#10;      breast reconstruction can damage the 'new' breast giving a less good breast shape and&#10;      appearance in the longer term. Also, if recovery is slow following surgery, the radiotherapy&#10;      is delayed which may reduce its effectiveness. Changing the order of treatments has been&#10;      shown to be safe and effective for chemotherapy, Herceptin and anticancer tablets but we&#10;      have very little information on giving radiotherapy before breast cancer surgery.&#10;&#10;      The investigators want to find out if giving radiotherapy before mastectomy and&#10;      reconstruction alters surgical complication rates and they want to evaluate the appearance&#10;      of the reconstructed breast when radiotherapy is given before surgery."

    briefsummary "Cancer of the gullet (oesophagus) is a lethal disease in which only 15% of patients survive&#10;      5 years once diagnosed. It is more common in men than women, and men appear to have a worse&#10;      prognosis. One suggestion for this gender difference is the sex hormone oestrogen, which&#10;      exerts its effect via oestrogen receptors. The role of oestrogen in breast cancer is well&#10;      described, and antioestrogen medication such as tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen receptors&#10;      are in widespread and effective use. The role of oestrogen receptors in oesophageal cancer&#10;      however, is less well defined. Work conducted by the investigators, as well as another&#10;      research group in Australia showed that antioestrogens including tamoxifen, reduce&#10;      oesophageal cancer cell growth in the laboratory. To date, no studies have assessed the&#10;      effect of tamoxifen therapy on oesophageal cancer growth in humans. The investigators&#10;      propose a study to determine the effect of tamoxifen in patients with oesophageal cancer who&#10;      aren't undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. Patients will receive tamoxifen tablets daily for&#10;      4 weeks after which time a biopsy (sample of cancer tissue) will be taken at gastroscopy (a&#10;      flexible camera that is passed into the mouth through the gullet into the stomach). The&#10;      biopsy will be compared with the biopsy taken at the time of diagnosis to determine if&#10;      tamoxifen has had any effect on cancer cell growth. If this study shows that tamoxifen does&#10;      slow cancer cell growth it could lead to a larger study of patients with oesophageal cancer&#10;      taking tamoxifen for a longer time period to determine if there is any clinical benefit."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing&#10;      so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the&#10;      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's&#10;      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses&#10;      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together&#10;      with filgrastim and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage IIIA&#10;      breast cancer."

    briefsummary "Patients are being asked to take part in this study because they have metastatic breast&#10;      cancer that is triple negative (does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone&#10;      receptor (PR) or HER2). This means that agents such as trastuzumab (Herceptin&#194;&#174;) and&#10;      tamoxifen are not currently treatment options for their cancer. Another option for treating&#10;      the patient's cancer at this point is with chemotherapy. The patient should discuss this and&#10;      other options with their doctor prior to entering this study.&#10;&#10;      Laboratory studies have demonstrated that ER is actually present in some triple negative&#10;      breast cancers but is &#34;silenced&#34; (does not function properly) because methyl and histone&#10;      groups are attached to it and inactivate it. Special drugs called demethylating inhibitors&#10;      (such as decitabine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as LBH589) can remove these&#10;      methyl and histone groups and reactivate ER. This reactivated ER can then be targeted with&#10;      agents like tamoxifen.&#10;&#10;      The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if ER can be&#10;      reactivated in their cancer using decitabine in combination with LBH589. If ER is&#10;      reactivated in their cancer, we will then determine if tamoxifen can decrease the growth of&#10;      the cancer."

    briefsummary "This randomized phase III clinical trial studies how well tamoxifen citrate, anastrozole,&#10;      letrozole, or exemestane with or without chemotherapy work in treating patients with breast&#10;      cancer that has spread from where it began in the breast to surrounding normal tissue&#10;      (invasive). Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy, using&#10;      tamoxifen citrate, may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor&#10;      cells. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, may fight&#10;      breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Drugs used in chemotherapy&#10;      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#10;      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether&#10;      giving tamoxifen citrate, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane is more effective with&#10;      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with breast cancer."

    briefsummary "Breast cancer is an optimal &#34;model disease&#34; for studying personalized medicine. Breast&#10;      cancer was the first malignancy for which a predictive factor forecasting response to&#10;      therapy was identified nearly 50 years ago; the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER).&#10;      Furthermore, breast cancer is by far the malignancy in which prognostic and predictive&#10;      factors have been most extensively studied. Primary medical treatment (pre-surgical medical&#10;      therapy) offers a unique setting to explore predictive factors due to the fact that primary&#10;      breast cancers are easily accessible to repeated tissue sampling and evaluation of therapy&#10;      response both clinically and radiologically. For many years, the investigators have studied&#10;      predictive factors in primary medical treatment of breast cancer. In the present project,&#10;      the investigators will implement a new trial concept where the current knowledge from&#10;      previous trials with respect to predictive markers (hormone receptors, HER2; TP53, CHEK2 and&#10;      RB1), will be combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Thereby, the investigators&#10;      aim to design the &#34;next-generation&#34; primary medical treatment where 1) therapy regimens are&#10;      individualized based on a limited number of known predictive factors and, 2) MPS is used to&#10;      explore additional predictive factors and their co-regulators in order to fully identify the&#10;      mechanisms of drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumours and pave the way for&#10;      further personalized breast cancer therapy in the future. As for the new era of &#34;genomic&#10;      medicine&#34;, the current trial concept will allow individual tumours to be characterized by&#10;      their unique gene mutation / epigenetic modification profile upfront, to allocate patients&#10;      to their optimal personalized medicine as compared to &#34;classical&#34; drug testing through phase&#10;      II/III trials."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill&#10;      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Estrogen can&#10;      stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight&#10;      breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen. Combining trastuzumab with tamoxifen may&#10;      kill more tumor cells.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of trastuzumab with or&#10;      without trastuzumab in treating women who have invasive stage IV breast cancer."

Tamoxifen is given to women with and at high risk for breast cancer. These&#10;      women also commonly have breast MRI to monitor for breast cancer.

If tamoxifen causes changes in normal breast tissue on MRI, more study could&#10;      be done looking at whether breast MRI could tell us anything about whether tamoxifen is&#10;      working.&#10;&#10;      This study is being done to see if tamoxifen changes normal breast tissue on MRI.

    briefsummary "It has been shown that women who have dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer&#10;      compared with women whose breasts are less dense. However, while breast density may be a&#10;      risk factor, the etiology of the relationship between breast cancer and breast density is&#10;      not understood. Furthermore, it is well recognized that breast cancer can still develop in&#10;      women whose breasts are not dense.&#10;&#10;      At menopause, the amount of breast glandular tissue and stroma naturally decreases due to a&#10;      lack of hormonal stimulation. This is characterized as a decrease in the mammographic&#10;      density. Although certain medications, including hormone therapy (HT) and dopamine&#10;      antagonists can increase breast density, these effects are reversible upon discontinuation&#10;      of the specific agent. Other medications such as the selective estrogen receptor modulators&#10;      (SERM), raloxifene (RAL) and tamoxifen, have been shown to not affect breast density and&#10;      allow the normal age-related changes to occur. The effects of bazedoxifene (BZA), a new&#10;      SERM, on breast density are not known. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of&#10;      BZA on breast density changes over 24 months in postmenopausal women. The results may be&#10;      useful for clinicians to understand the effect of BZA on breast density and its mammographic&#10;      effects.&#10;&#10;      This is an observational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active&#10;      comparator-controlled study. It is also an ancillary that will use women who are already&#10;      participants in a phase 3 trial for fracture reduction (protocol 3068A1-301-WW; primary&#10;      study). In the primary study, subjects received BZA 20 mg, BZA 40 mg, RAL 60 mg, or placebo.&#10;      This ancillary study will request a subset of participants to use their mammograms taken in&#10;      this study. Their mammogram will be digitized by a central imaging center. A single&#10;      radiologist will perform the quantifications of breast density from the digitized&#10;      mammograms."

The primary endpoint is the difference&#10;      in efficacy of tamoxifen, defined as the objective response rate using RECIST criteria,&#10;      between women with a normal versus low Tamoxifen Activity Score (TAS) after 3-6 months of&#10;      tamoxifen use. The TAS score is based on the presence of genetic variations and drug&#10;      interactions. Secondary endpoints are time to progression, clinical benefit, serum&#10;      metabolite concentrations, endometrial changes and menopausal symptoms. Patients using&#10;      tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting needs being operated between 4-6 months following the&#10;      start of tamoxifen."

Giving more than one&#10;      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of&#10;      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the&#10;      use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount&#10;      of estrogen the body makes. Giving chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery may kill&#10;      any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether genetic testing is&#10;      more effective than clinical assessment in determining the need for chemotherapy in treating&#10;      breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying genetic testing to see how well it&#10;      works compared with clinical assessment in determining the need for chemotherapy in women&#10;      with breast cancer that is either node-negative or involves no more than 3 lymph nodes."

    briefsummary "Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor&#10;      (ER)-positive breast cancer, high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems&#10;      counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function, while estrogens increase ER&#10;      function, but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of&#10;      metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that&#10;      develop resistance to anti-estrogens, likely because such cancers have adapted to grow&#10;      without ER function, and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer&#10;      cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens,&#10;      treatment with the estrogen 17b-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore, when&#10;      17b-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17b-estradiol, switching back&#10;      to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can&#10;      alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17b-estradiol-sensitive states. The&#10;      investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17b-estradiol / anti-estrogen&#10;      therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth&#10;      than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic&#10;      anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer."

    briefsummary "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.S. Targeted therapies such as tamoxifen&#10;      have been revolutionary in reducing tumor recurrences and mortality in early breast cancer.&#10;      Using this successful paradigm, there has been a continued search for other targeted&#10;      biologic therapies directed at receptors with known potential for promoting tumor growth.&#10;&#10;      The estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the HER signaling pathways are the dominant drivers of&#10;      cell proliferation and survival in the majority of human breast cancers. Molecular targets&#10;      of these pathways provide the most effective therapies in appropriately selected patients.&#10;      However, de novo and acquired resistance remain major obstacles to successful treatment, and&#10;      understanding the molecular pathways responsible for this resistance would enable the&#10;      discovery of new strategies to overcome it.&#10;&#10;      The superiority of multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy over single agent therapy has been&#10;      demonstrated in the preclinical setting using mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab,&#10;      lapatinib, and gefitinib, represent a group of therapeutic agents that target the HER family&#10;      by different molecular mechanisms. Used as single agents in the MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft&#10;      model, these drugs restored or enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, tumor growth&#10;      inhibition lasted only 2-3 months before resistance to treatments occurred. However, when&#10;      gefitinib, a HER1 inhibitor, was added to the two-antibody (T+P) regimen to block signals&#10;      from HER1 dimers, a complete disappearance of nearly all xenograft tumors was observed;&#10;      moreover, there was evidence of complete tumor eradication in 50% of the mice. The&#10;      combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was also highly effective in eradication of tumor&#10;      burden, with no evidence of re-growth after 200 days. These xenograft models demonstrate&#10;      that multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy more effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits&#10;      proliferation, thereby resulting in tumor regression. Furthermore, HER2 combination therapy&#10;      appears to more effectively reduce levels of phosphorylated pAKT and MAPK, thus resulting in&#10;      sustained tumor inhibition."

Used adjuvantly after&#10;      operation in early breast cancer, tamoxifen reduces annual recurrence rate by half and&#10;      cancer death by one third. Used preventatively it also reduces the risk of breast cancer by&#10;      50% in women at high risk for developing the disease Tamoxifen needs to be activated in the&#10;      body to an active form called endoxifen, mainly by the enzyme called CYP2D6. Patients have&#10;      variable capability to activate tamoxifen due to variable function of this enzyme. Studies&#10;      showed clear correlation of specific genetic variant of CYP2D6 with endoxifen blood levels.&#10;      It is estimated that up to 25% Caucasian population have reduced or even absent CYP2D6&#10;      function. More recently, there were studies that showed the correlation with genetic variant&#10;      of CYP2D6 and breast cancer relapse in early breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.&#10;      Food and Drug Authority (FDA) in America and recommended checking CYP2D6 genotype in&#10;      patients receiving tamoxifen treatment, but they did not specify how to interpret the&#10;      genotype results and what kind actions to take in patient with adverse genotype. The aim of&#10;      the investigators study is to see if increasing tamoxifen in patients with genetic&#10;      polymorphism of CYP2D6 will increase endoxifen level to the same range of most patients who&#10;      have wild type (normal functional)CYP2D6."

    briefsummary "Background:&#10;&#10;      - Studies have shown that changes in breast density (the amount of white area on a woman's&#10;      mammogram) may be related to changes in breast cancer risk. Currently, there is no ideal way&#10;      to measure breast density repeatedly over time. Researchers want to test whether ultrasound&#10;      tomography scans can show changes in breast density. To examine these changes, healthy&#10;      volunteers with no history of breast cancer and women who are taking tamoxifen will have&#10;      ultrasound tomography scans.&#10;&#10;      Objectives:&#10;&#10;      - To test whether ultrasound tomography scans can show changes in breast density related to&#10;      tamoxifen exposure.&#10;&#10;      Eligibility:&#10;&#10;      - Women between 30 and 70 years of age who are (a) taking tamoxifen or (b) healthy&#10;      volunteers who have never had breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      Design:&#10;&#10;        -  All participants will have a screening visit. Healthy volunteers will have one&#10;           additional study visit; women taking tamoxifen will have three additional study visits.&#10;&#10;        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#10;           also give blood and saliva samples. This visit will also include an initial ultrasound&#10;           tomography breast scan.&#10;&#10;        -  For the healthy volunteers:&#10;&#10;        -  At the study visit (12 months after the screening visit), participants will have a&#10;           short interview and be weighed. They will also have an ultrasound tomography breast&#10;           scan and provide a blood sample.&#10;&#10;        -  For the women taking tamoxifen:&#10;&#10;        -  At the second and third visits (1 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months after starting&#10;           tamoxifen), participants will have a short interview. They will also be weighed and&#10;           have an ultrasound tomography breast scan.&#10;&#10;        -  At the fourth visit (12 months after starting tamoxifen), participants will have a&#10;           short interview, weight measurement, and the ultrasound tomography breast scan, and&#10;           will also provide a blood sample.&#10;&#10;        -  All participants may be followed for up to 5 years after their final study visit."

The investigators hypothesize that DNA&#10;      methylation of certain genes occurs as a field change in benign breast tissue that is at&#10;      high risk for malignant transformation, and as such, can be exploited for tissue-based&#10;      breast cancer risk stratification. Additional work is required to identify new DNA&#10;      methylation markers potentially useful for periareolar fine needle aspiration (RP-FNA)-based&#10;      breast cancer risk stratification, to determine whether these markers are methylated more&#10;      frequently in benign samples from women who develop breast cancer, to determine whether&#10;      assessment of these markers is reproducible, to determine whether tamoxifen reduces DNA&#10;      methylation, and to better understand the pattern of DNA methylation in benign samples from&#10;      unselected healthy control populations. Each of these objectives contributes to advancement&#10;      of a clinically useful RP-FNA-based breast cancer risk stratification test.&#10;&#10;      In addition, identification of genes that are preferentially methylated in estrogen receptor&#10;      (ER) negative breast cancer will provide clues to the underlying biology responsible for&#10;      this aggressive form of breast cancer. This knowledge may lead to the discovery of the&#10;      causes of ER negative breast cancer, approaches for recognizing women at increased risk for&#10;      this type of breast cancer, and approaches for reducing this risk.&#10;&#10;      This study seeks to identify patterns of DNA methylation in benign breast epithelial cells&#10;      associated with an increased risk for breast cancer with a focus on ER negative breast&#10;      cancer."

Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing&#10;      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor&#10;      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming&#10;      normal cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or&#10;      without trastuzumab in treating breast cancer."

    briefsummary "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly&#10;      boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births. The pathology of DMD is a result of&#10;      non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process&#10;      known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only&#10;      therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression.&#10;      The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of&#10;      life from severe heart and lung problems.&#10;&#10;      In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD&#10;      boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an&#10;      outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other&#10;      pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.&#10;&#10;      Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:&#10;&#10;      (i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists&#10;      in the repair of damaged muscles.&#10;&#10;      In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to&#10;      its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial&#10;      effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Also, a small compassionate cohort of 3 boys, treated&#10;      for 6 months with Tamoxifen, yielded very encouraging results."

    briefsummary "The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of stopping aromatase inhibitory&#10;      (AI) therapy on breast cancer progression. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to&#10;      treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They work by decreasing the level of estrogen,&#10;      which is believed to stimulate the growth of tumor tissue. Breast cancer that progresses&#10;      despite therapy with an AI is thought to have been resistant to AI therapy. There is&#10;      scientific evidence to suggest that resistant breast cancer cells learn to grow at the very&#10;      low levels of estrogen present on AI therapy and that increasing estrogen levels even&#10;      slightly by stopping AI therapy with inhibit the breast cancer cells. An improvement or&#10;      stabilization of breast cancer has been observed after stopping therapy with tamoxifen, a&#10;      different anti-estrogen therapy, and has been reported in the literature after stopping AI&#10;      therapy. This research study will be the first study to formally test the rate of disease&#10;      improvement (response) or stabilization after stopping AI therapy."

The trial will include 29&#10;      patients over a period of 15 months + 24 months of follow up maximum.&#10;&#10;      The study will be conduct in womens with metastatic invasive breast cancer or locally&#10;      advanced breast cancer and for which treatment with tamoxifen or anti aromatase (first line&#10;      hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer) is indicated.&#10;&#10;      The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility to detect in the&#10;      circulating blood of patients, before treatment (T0), the presence of the fifteen tissular&#10;      microRNAs described in preclinical studies as possibly involved in hormone&#10;      resistance/sensitivity.&#10;&#10;      In parallel of the detection of these specific miRNAs, we will conduct a larger scale&#10;      analysis of circulating miRNAs in these patients before (T = 0) and after one month of&#10;      treatment (T28)."

It has also&#10;      been shown that decreasing density with a drug called tamoxifen has resulted in a decreased&#10;      risk in breast cancer. The investigators are looking at the effect of hCG on breast density&#10;      in people who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and our theory postulates&#10;      that through the hormonal actions of hCG and tamoxifen there would be a greater reduction in&#10;      breast density in patients who are treated with hCG and tamoxifen versus patients treated&#10;      with tamoxifen alone. Using this data the investigators will be able to hypothesize that the&#10;      treatment of hCG will result in a reduction in breast cancer rates in the population and&#10;      thus make available another drug which can be used to decrease the rates of breast cancer in&#10;      the population"

    sourceid "nct"
    type "trial"
    briefsummary "The long-lasting phase of precursors of invasive cancer, i.e. dysplasia or intraepithelial&#10;      neoplasia (IEN), is particularly relevant among risk determinants. At present, about 15-20%&#10;      of all breast cancers are diagnosed in a non-invasive phase. Despite their good prognosis,&#10;      women with breast IEN (lobular and ductal intraepithelial neoplasia, LIN and DIN) have a&#10;      10-15/1000 annual risk of invasive disease (8-10 times the same age general population), and&#10;      thus represent an important target for chemoprevention. In the National Surgical Adjuvant&#10;      Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP-P1 trial), tamoxifen use at 20 mg/day was associated with a&#10;      86% reduction of invasive breast cancer in women with previous atypical ductal hyperplasia&#10;      (ADH) (RR=0.14, 95% IC, 0.03-0.47) and with a 56% risk reduction in women with previous&#10;      Lobular Carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (RR=0.44, 95% IC, 0.16-1.06). However, tamoxifen use in&#10;      this setting is hampered by serious adverse events attributable to its partial estrogenic&#10;      activity, such as increased risk of endometrial cancer and of venous thromboembolism, which&#10;      have significantly limited its broad use in chemoprevention.&#10;&#10;      To improve the risk-benefit ratio, the use of lower doses of the drug has been proposed.&#10;      Recent trials from our group have shown that the dose can be reduced up to 1 mg/day with no&#10;      loss of tamoxifen antiproliferative activity on breast cancer. By contrast, a dose of 5&#10;      mg/day does not increase endometrial proliferation and is associated with a decrease of the&#10;      estrogenic activity of tamoxifen on insulin like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormone-binding&#10;      globulin (SHBG) and antithrombin-III, with a potential decrease of venous thromboembolic&#10;      events. Moreover, tamoxifen exhibits a high tissue distribution, so that a dose of 5 mg/day&#10;      attains at the breast tissue level a concentration 10 times higher than that needed to&#10;      inhibit cell growth in vitro. The promising clinical activity of 5 mg/day of tamoxifen is&#10;      supported by an ongoing 2x2 phase IIb trial of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide in&#10;      premenopausal women, where tamoxifen lowers breast cancer events compared with placebo. The&#10;      cytochromeP450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme mediates oxidation of N-desmethyl tamoxifen to endoxifen,&#10;      the most active metabolite of tamoxifen. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYP2D6*4&#10;      (1846G>A) allele accounts for 75% of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype and poor metabolizers&#10;      showed a trend to a higher risk to develop a breast event compared to wildtype."

In current clinical practice, patients with invasive&#10;      lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma&#10;      based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification&#10;      of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in&#10;      ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast&#10;      cancer subtype.&#10;&#10;      PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in&#10;      reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in&#10;      expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve&#10;      as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.&#10;&#10;      Primary Objective:&#10;&#10;      To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive,&#10;      HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or&#10;      further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine&#10;      treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg&#10;      given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily)."

    briefsummary "This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug bevacizumab, in combination with&#10;      doxorubicin and docetaxel, in improving survival of patients with inflammatory breast cancer&#10;      or locally advanced breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of&#10;      locally advanced breast cancer that often causes a red, swollen, tender breast and is&#10;      associated with a poor prognosis. Bevacizumab blocks the growth of new blood vessels that&#10;      supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors, and therefore, may kill cancer cells or stop their&#10;      growth. Doxorubicin and docetaxel are approved drugs for treating breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      Patients 18 years of age or older with stage inflammatory breast cancer who have not been&#10;      treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#10;      are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, chest&#10;      x-ray, electrocardiogram, and MUGA scan or echocardiography (see below). A mammogram of both&#10;      breasts, dynamic MRI imaging of the affected breast, computed tomography (CT) of the head,&#10;      chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan are done to determine the extent of disease.&#10;&#10;      Participants undergo the following procedures at various intervals before, during and/or&#10;      after completing chemotherapy:&#10;&#10;      Tumor and skin biopsies to study the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood vessels, tumor&#10;      growth, and the biology of inflammatory breast cancer. A small piece of tumor tissue and a&#10;      small piece of skin from the affected breast are removed under local anesthesia for&#10;      microscopic study.&#10;&#10;      Dynamic MRI to examine changes in the blood vessels and breast cancer following bevacizumab&#10;      treatment. This test involves injecting a contrast liquid into a vein before scanning. A&#10;      standard MRI scan is done before the dynamic MRI.&#10;&#10;      Blood tests are done to 1) study clot formation and breakdown, 2) measure levels of VEGF (a&#10;      substance produced by breast cancer cells) and VCAM-1 (a substance produced by cells lining&#10;      blood vessel walls), and 3) check blood counts and liver and kidney function.&#10;&#10;      MUGA (a nuclear medicine scan that checks the heart's pumping ability) or echocardiogram&#10;      (ultrasound scan of the heart to evaluate heart function.&#10;&#10;      Blood pressure monitoring&#10;&#10;      Urine tests&#10;&#10;      CT scans and x-rays to evaluate disease before and after treatment.&#10;&#10;      Patients will have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the&#10;      chest before beginning treatment. The line stays in the body during the entire treatment&#10;      period and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications, if needed, and to draw blood&#10;      samples. All treatment is given on a single day every 3 weeks. This constitutes one&#10;      treatment cycle. Cycle 1 consists of bevacizumab alone; cycles 2 through 7 consist of&#10;      bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel. During each cycle, patients also receive&#10;      injections under the skin of G-CSF, a drug that raises the number of infection-fighting&#10;      white blood cells, which are often decreased as a side effect of chemotherapy. After cycle&#10;      7, patients may require surgery and radiation or radiation alone. After radiation treatment,&#10;      bevacizumab is re-started, given alone every 3 weeks for an additional eight cycles.&#10;      Patients whose tumors are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptors will be advised to&#10;      take the drug tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years to decrease the chances of disease&#10;      recurrence. This would begin with cycle 8."

However, over time the breast cancer cells can&#10;      become resistant to tamoxifen and letrozole. MK-0752 is in a class of drugs called gamma&#10;      secretase inhibitors. Gamma secretase inhibitors may play a role in reversing the resistance&#10;      to drugs such as tamoxifen and letrozole."

    sourceid "nct"
    type "trial"
    briefsummary "More than three quarter of patients with breast cancer are treated by hormone pills called&#10;      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production.&#10;      This hormone production mostly happens in fat, muscle, and breast tissue in postmenopausal&#10;      women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer&#10;      cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex&#194;&#174;) and Letrozole (Femara&#194;&#174;) are AIs that are approved by the Food&#10;      and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early&#10;      stage breast cancer.&#10;&#10;      When given before surgery (neoadjuvant), both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to&#10;      successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients,&#10;      anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery&#10;      outcomes. On top of that, whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole&#10;      before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional&#10;      chemotherapy.&#10;&#10;      One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously&#10;      shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as&#10;      well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase&#10;      activity in the fatty tissue. However, at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in&#10;      all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently,&#10;      we do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with&#10;      higher body fat compared to patients with less body fat.&#10;&#10;      The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI&#10;      treatment compared to women with lower body fat."
