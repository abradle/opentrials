The investigators plan to examine this hypothesis&#10;      in a well-characterized cohort of obese subjects that are scheduled for bariatric surgery.&#10;      Methyl-D9-choline chloride will be infused before and after a 2-week high fructose or&#10;      glucose feeding to determine the biosynthesis and kinetics of secretory lipoprotein&#10;      phospholipids. It is proposed that phospholipid metabolism play an important role in the&#10;      pathogenesis or etiology of fatty liver in non-alcoholic conditions through mechanisms that&#10;      invoke ER and oxidative stress responses."

    sourceid "nct"
    type "trial"
    briefsummary "A. BACKGROUND Accumulation of fat in the liver due to non-alcoholic causes (NAFLD) is&#10;      associated with hepatic insulin resistance, which impairs the ability of insulin to inhibit&#10;      the production of glucose and VLDL . This leads to increases in serum glucose, insulin and&#10;      triglyceride concentrations as well as hyperinsulinemia. Recent epidemiologic studies have&#10;      shown that a major reason for the metabolic syndrome as well as the accompanying increased&#10;      risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes is overconsumption of simple sugars. The&#10;      investigators have recently shown that overeating simple sugars (1000 extra calories/day,&#10;      &#34;CANDY&#34; diet) increases liver fat content by 30% within 3 weeks (4), and recapitulates&#10;      features of the metabolic syndrome such as hypertriglyceridemia and a low HDL cholesterol&#10;      concentration.&#10;&#10;      The fatty acids in intrahepatocellular triglycerides may originate from peripheral&#10;      lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis, uptake of chylomicron remnants by the liver and from hepatic&#10;      uptake of fatty acids released during intravascular hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich&#10;      lipoproteins (the spillover pathway). A classic study using stable isotope methodology by&#10;      the group of Elisabeth Parks showed that in subjects with NAFLD, the excess&#10;      intrahepatocellular triglycerides originate from peripheral lipolysis and de novo&#10;      lipogenesis.&#10;&#10;      It is well-established that ingestion of a high carbohydrate as compared to high fat diet&#10;      stimulates de novo lipogenesis in humans. Meta-analyses comparing isocaloric high fat and&#10;      high carbohydrate diets have shown that high carbohydrate but not high fat diets increase&#10;      increase serum triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Since hypertriglyceridemia results&#10;      from overproduction of VLDL from the liver, these data suggest the composition of the diet&#10;      influences hepatic lipid metabolism. Whether this is because overfeeding fat leads to&#10;      preferential deposition of fat in adipose tissue while high carbohydrate diets induce a&#10;      relative greater increase in liver fat is unknown. There are no previous studies comparing&#10;      effects of chronic overfeeding of fat as compared to carbohydrate on liver fat or and the&#10;      sources of intrahepatic fatty acids.&#10;&#10;      A common polymorphism in PNPLA3 at rs738409 (adiponutrin) gene is associated with a markedly&#10;      increase liver fat content. This finding has been replicated in at least 20 studies across&#10;      the world. The investigators have shown that PNPLA3 is regulated by the carbohydrate&#10;      response element binding protein 1. Mice overexpressing the human I148M PNPLA3 variant in&#10;      the liver exhibit an increase in liver triglycerides and cholesteryl esters on a high&#10;      sucrose but not high fat diet. These data suggest that overfeeding a high carbohydrate as&#10;      compared to a high fat diet may increase liver fat more in subjects carrying the I148M&#10;      allele than in non-carriers.&#10;&#10;      B. HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that overfeeding a high fat as compared to an&#10;      isocaloric high carbohydrate diet influences the source of intrahepatocellular&#10;      triglycerides. During a high fat diet, relatively more of intrahepatocellular triglycerides&#10;      originate from peripheral lipolysis and less from DNL than during a high carbohydrate diet&#10;      in the face of a similar increase in liver fat. It is also possible given the lack of&#10;      previous overfeeding data comparing 2 different overfeeding diets that the high fat diet&#10;      induces a smaller increase in liver fat than a high carbohydrate diet even in the face of an&#10;      identical increase in caloric intake because a greater fraction of ingested fat is channeled&#10;      to adipose tissue than the liver. The investigators also hypothesize that liver fat may&#10;      increase more in carriers than non-carriers of the I148M variant in PNPLA3 during a high&#10;      carbohydrate than a high fat diet.&#10;&#10;      C. SPECIFIC AIMS The investigators wish to randomize, using the method of minimization&#10;      (considers baseline age, BMI, gender, liver fat, PNPLA3 genotype) 40 non-diabetic subjects&#10;      with NAFLD as determined by the non-invasive score developed in our laboratory or previous&#10;      knowledge of liver fat content based on MRS to overeat either a high carbohydrate or high&#10;      fat diet (1000 extra calories per day) for 3 weeks. Before and after the overfeeding diets,&#10;      will measure liver fat content by 1H-MRS and the rate of adipose tissue lipolysis using&#10;      doubly labeled water (DDW) and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5] glycerol as described in detail below. The&#10;      investigators also wish to characterize glucose, insulin, fatty acid and triacylglyceride&#10;      profiles before and while on the experimental diet. An adipose tissue biopsy is taken to&#10;      determine whether expression of genes involved in lipogenesis or lipolysis, or those&#10;      involved in adipose tissue inflammation change in response to overfeeding, and for&#10;      measurement of LPL activity. After overfeeding, both groups will undergo weight loss to&#10;      restore normal weight as described in our recent study. The metabolic study is repeated&#10;      after weight loss."

    briefsummary "The incidence of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase, and&#10;      prevalence estimates for NAFLD range from 17-33%, making it is the most common cause of&#10;      chronic liver disease in North America. It is associated with increased cardiovascular&#10;      morbidity as well as progression to cirrhosis is a subset of patients. There is currently no&#10;      approved treatment for NAFLD. A key barrier to the development of effective therapies is a&#10;      lack of consensus on the criteria for diagnosis and endpoints for studies evaluating&#10;      diagnostic markers, prognosis and therapeutic modalities.&#10;&#10;      NAFLD encompasses an entire pathological spectrum of disease, from relatively benign&#10;      accumulation of lipid (steatosis) to progressive non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)&#10;      associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis. It has been estimated that 20-30% of&#10;      patients with NAFLD will exhibit biochemical and histological changes characteristic of&#10;      NASH, and 15-20% of those patients will progress to have cirrhosis. NASH remains an&#10;      important phenotypic state, because this sub-group of patients is deemed at high-risk for&#10;      developing progressive disease resulting in cirrhosis, liver failure requiring&#10;      transplantation, or death.&#10;&#10;      Although NAFLD has not to date been included as a component of the metabolic syndrome, there&#10;      is increasing evidence that NAFLD frequently accompanies the development of insulin&#10;      resistance and therefore may be an indicator or predictor of future cardiometabolic risk.&#10;      Moreover, recent findings in skeletal muscle of experimental insulin resistance (lipid&#10;      infusion) as well as naturally occurring obese and type 2 diabetic, insulin resistant&#10;      patients show that skeletal muscle inflammation leads to a pattern of extracellular matrix,&#10;      structural, and remodeling abnormalities that closely resemble the TGFb, connective tissue&#10;      growth factor (CTGF) mediated fibrotic response that differentiates simple steatotic liver&#10;      from NASH. This suggests there may be a common underlying mechanism. Given the ready&#10;      availability of skeletal muscle tissue using percutaneous needle muscle biopsies, compared&#10;      to the more invasive liver biopsy, it may be possible to use characteristics of skeletal&#10;      muscle to distinguish the severity of liver fibrosis.&#10;&#10;      Given the preponderance of patients being identified with NAFLD, the recognition of less and&#10;      non invasive tests that help to discriminate the different phenotypic types of NAFLD would&#10;      be highly practical and useful. This would help identify patients at risk of progression to&#10;      cirrhosis, and thus make them the target of any available therapeutic interventions.&#10;&#10;      The investigators hypothesize that 1. Insulin resistance measured through glucose tolerance&#10;      test directly correlates with the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis, and 2. Inflammation&#10;      and fibrosis in the skeletal muscles correlates with the histopathological changes seen in&#10;      patients with NAFLD, and potentially skeletal muscle inflammation may be used as a&#10;      diagnostic predictor to differentiate patients with NASH from patients with simple&#10;      steatosis.&#10;&#10;      The overall goal of this project is to determine the extent to which inflammation and&#10;      fibrosis in skeletal muscle mirrors and is predictive of the level of liver inflammation and&#10;      can distinguish NASH from simple steatosis. Specifically, the investigators propose the&#10;      following Aims:&#10;&#10;        1. To use estimates of insulin sensitivity from modeling of oral glucose tolerance tests&#10;           to test the hypothesis that the extent of liver and muscle fibrosis is directly related&#10;           to insulin resistance.&#10;&#10;        2. To use liver and muscle biopsies to characterize the changes in abundance of mRNAs and&#10;           proteins that characterize inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis.&#10;           The investigators will use quantitative rt-PCR and immunoblot analysis to compare mRNA&#10;           expression and protein abundance of collagens I and III, fibronectin, and connective&#10;           tissue growth factor (CTGF) to test the hypothesis that there is a direct relationship&#10;           between the levels of these proteins in muscle and liver and the degree of fibrosis.&#10;&#10;        3. To establish a biospecimen repository of serum, mRNA from circulating white blood&#10;           cells, liver and muscle tissue, and DNA to serve as the substrate for future studies of&#10;           the pathogenesis of NASH."

    briefsummary "Vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of preventable diseases such as&#10;      type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These effects may be mediated through direct or&#10;      indirect pathways. Although the high intakes of nuts, legumes, dietary fibre, whole grains,&#10;      and unsaturated plant oils have each individually been associated with lower risk of type 2&#10;      diabetes and cardiovascular disease, so too has the displacement of red meats, processed&#10;      meats, and saturated animal fats. One of the most important considerations in moving from&#10;      animal-based diets to more plant-based diets is the replacement of animal proteins (e.g.&#10;      meat, fish, dairy, eggs) with vegetable proteins (e.g. legumes, nuts, and seeds). It is&#10;      unclear whether this particular replacement alone results in advantages for metabolic and&#10;      cardiovascular health. To improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines and health&#10;      claims development, we propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses&#10;      of the effect of plant-based protein in exchange for animal protein on blood lipids,&#10;      glycemic control, blood pressure, body weight, uric acid, markers of non-alcoholic fatty&#10;      liver disease (NAFLD), and kidney function and injury. The systematic review process allows&#10;      the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled&#10;      estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be able&#10;      to explore whether the effects of replacing animal-based protein for plant-based protein&#10;      hold true across different sexes, age groups, and background disease states and whether the&#10;      effect depends on the protein source, dose, or background diet. The findings of this&#10;      proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians through informing&#10;      recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk of heart disease and&#10;      diabetes."

    briefsummary "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined by presence of hepatic steatosis (fat&#10;      accumulation in liver cells), either by imaging or by biopsy and absence of causes for&#10;      secondary hepatic fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption, medications, or&#10;      hereditary disorders. In the majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with risk factors for&#10;      cardiovascular disease such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and high cholesterol, and may&#10;      lead to irreversible liver damage. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe&#10;      form of NAFLD and is present in up to 30% of obese adults. NASH is defined by hepatic&#10;      steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury with or without fibrosis (hardening of the&#10;      liver).&#10;&#10;      The prevalence, morbidity and mortality of NAFLD is increasing, particularly in the&#10;      Asia-Pacific region where there will be an estimated 300 million obese people by 2030.&#10;      Weight loss is the first-line treatment for NAFLD in obese individuals, but the utility of&#10;      lifestyle modification with diet and exercise is limited by difficulties in sustaining&#10;      compliance and by eventual weight regain. Bariatric (weight loss) surgery produces the&#10;      greatest amount of weight loss but is limited by cost, patient acceptance, and&#10;      complications. The efficacy of drugs for NASH, such as vitamin E and medication to lower&#10;      cholesterol and glucose, remains unclear. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1)&#10;      analogue, is an injectable medication which has been shown to induce weight loss and lower&#10;      glucose in obese adults. There is little information on the effects of GLP-1 analogues on&#10;      NASH, particularly in comparison to other modalities of weight loss such as surgery. This&#10;      study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of lifestyle modification, liraglutide and&#10;      surgery, for weight loss in conjunction with reducing severity of NASH, and for insulin&#10;      resistance, high cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors."

    briefsummary "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered as the hepatic manifestation of the&#10;      metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a pathologic condition which involves both hepatic steatosis&#10;      and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as the result of fat accumulation in the liver&#10;      (liver fat >5-10% of liver weight), not due to excess alcohol consumption or other causes of&#10;      steatosis.&#10;&#10;      At present, no medication or surgical procedure has been approved for treating NAFLD and&#10;      lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone therapy targeting both at weight reduction&#10;      for overweight subjects and at prevention of overweight for the normal weight individuals.&#10;      Given that a Mediterranean dietary pattern has a beneficial effect both on the prevention&#10;      and the resolution of the metabolic syndrome, the main aim of the present study is to&#10;      implement and evaluate the potential benefits of an intervention based on the Mediterranean&#10;      lifestyle in a sample of patients with NAFLD."

A subset of these will develop&#10;      progressive disease in the form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress&#10;      to cirrhosis and liver failure. NAFLD is expected to be the most common indication for liver&#10;      transplantation by the year 2020. We hypothesize that growth hormone (GH) replacement will&#10;      decrease intrahepatic lipid accumulation as quantified by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#10;      (1H-MRS)."

NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of&#10;      triglycerides and other lipids. The first-line approach to NAFLD management is caloric&#10;      restriction and weight loss, but these remain difficult to achieve. Little attention has&#10;      been given to dietary carbohydrate restriction, despite recent reports showing that hepatic&#10;      de novo lipogenesis, a process that converts dietary carbohydrates into fatty acids in the&#10;      postprandial state, accounts for approximately 25% of liver triglyceride content in&#10;      hyperinsulinemic subjects with NAFLD. For comparison, only 15% of the liver triglycerides&#10;      were derived from dietary fatty acids in patients with NAFLD who had consumed a standardized&#10;      30% fat diet for four days before being assessed."

This phenomenon has induce an increase in the&#10;      incidence of serious health complications starting in childhood and adolescence. Lifestyle&#10;      interventions, including diet and regular physical activity, are the cornerstone of current&#10;      medical management. Unfortunately, these interventions are often ineffective in providing a&#10;      meaningful and long-lasting weight loss necessary to change health outcomes. It has been&#10;      demonstrated that an early intervention in obesity in children and adolescents, inducing&#10;      weight loss by performing bariatric surgery in carefully selected patients, can dramatically&#10;      reduce the risk of adulthood obesity and obesity-related diseases, including non-alcoholic&#10;      fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#10;&#10;      Recent evidence suggest that bariatric surgery can improve metabolic complications and liver&#10;      involvement in patients affected by morbid obesity."

In western countries, the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population is&#10;      estimated to be 20-30%; in obese populations, this increases to 57.5-74%. But, it hasn`t&#10;      been clearly elucidated yet regarding the underlying disease pathophysiology and treatmet&#10;      strategy.&#10;&#10;      Recently, members of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family have been&#10;      reported to share structural homology with adiponectin. To date, 15 CTRP family members have&#10;      been found that might play major roles in glucose metabolism and inflammation.&#10;&#10;      The investigators tried to clarify the relationship between CTRP family and NAFLD in Korean&#10;      men and women."

    briefsummary "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and is rapidly&#10;      becoming the one of most common causes of chronic liver disease in children. The&#10;      pathogenesis of NAFLD is generally considered the result of a series of liver injuries,&#10;      commonly referred as &#34;multi-hit&#34; hypothesis. Several studies suggest that inflammatory&#10;      pathways and oxidative stress could be responsible of disease progression to non-alcoholic&#10;      steatohepatitis (NASH).&#10;&#10;      Hydroxytyrosol is a simple phenolic compound naturally occurring in olive and olive oil with&#10;      antioxidant properties. Some studies have demonstrated that hydroxytyrosol show several&#10;      anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activities, such as the inhibition of LDL oxidation&#10;      and platelet aggregation.&#10;&#10;      Alpha tocopherol (Vitamin E) is the most studied anti-oxydant in pediatric NAFLD with&#10;      conflicting results. It inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production and attenuates the&#10;      release of profibrogenic agents and liver collagen.&#10;&#10;      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of&#10;      Hydroxytyrosol and Vitamin E in the treatment of children with biopsy-proven NASH."

    briefsummary "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and is rapidly&#10;      becoming the one of most common causes of chronic liver disease in children. The&#10;      pathogenesis of NAFLD is generally considered the result of a series of liver injuries,&#10;      commonly referred as &#34;multi-hit&#34; hypothesis. Several studies suggest that inflammatory&#10;      pathways and oxidative stress could be responsible of disease progression.&#10;&#10;      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of&#10;      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Vitamin D in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven&#10;      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."

    briefsummary "One-third of the US population has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to obesity&#10;      and ~8 million of these individuals have a progressive form of the disease, non-alcoholic&#10;      steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no noninvasive ways to determine which&#10;      individuals with NAFLD will develop NASH. This is of medical importance since NASH can be a&#10;      prelude to the development of end-stage liver disease.&#10;&#10;      The study of NAFLD has been limited by several factors, including the difficulties&#10;      associated with studying liver metabolism in vivo in humans. Our group has pioneered new&#10;      methods that use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure intermediary hepatic metabolism&#10;      in humans with a goal of directly studying the pathophysiology of bland steatosis and NASH.&#10;      In this study, these noninvasive methods will be used to characterize and compare the&#10;      metabolic alterations that accompany bland steatosis and NASH and test the hypothesis that&#10;      detects if hepatic mitochondrial metabolism contribute to both disorders. Such&#10;      characterization is fundamental to establishing a rational approach to the prevention and&#10;      treatment of NAFLD and may provide simple, non-invasive methods to differentiate benign and&#10;      progressive forms of NAFLD.&#10;&#10;      This proposal will be addressed via separate isotopic studies occurring at different time&#10;      points during a prolonged fast. In subjects with NAFLD, these studies will be carried out&#10;      before and after treatment with Vitamin E or placebo.&#10;&#10;      Healthy subjects will participate in initial baseline studies only without Vitamin E or&#10;      placebo intervention.&#10;&#10;      The study is designed to harness the physiologic changes that occur with short- and&#10;      long-term fasting to provide a rapid and cost-effective method to accomplish the aims of the&#10;      application."

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of&#10;      NAFLD in which increased liver fat is also accompanied by inflammation, cellular damage, and&#10;      fibrosis.&#10;&#10;      NAFLD is most prevalent in patients who also have increased visceral adiposity, and our&#10;      group has previously shown that HIV-infected individuals with increased visceral adiposity&#10;      generally have decreased growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone releasing&#10;      hormone (GHRH) analogue that increases endogenous growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is&#10;      FDA-approved for the reduction of visceral fat in HIV-infected individuals. In a previous&#10;      study, treatment with tesamorelin in HIV-infected individuals selected for abdominal&#10;      adiposity reduced liver fat. The current study is designed to test the effect of tesamorelin&#10;      on liver fat and steatohepatitis in HIV-infected individuals who have NAFLD. The&#10;      investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will reduce liver fat and will also ameliorate&#10;      the inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular damage seen in conjunction with NASH."

    briefsummary "Liver fibrosis is an important public health problem, with a substantial morbidity and&#10;      mortality due to progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. All causes of&#10;      chronic liver disease may lead to fibrosis. The traditional diagnostic approach requires a&#10;      biopsy for assessing the severity of liver disease prior to therapy.&#10;&#10;      However, liver biopsy has several limitations: cost, sampling error, and procedure-related&#10;      morbidity and mortality. Considering the high prevalence of viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic&#10;      fatty liver disease, a condition often associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, there is&#10;      an urgent need for noninvasive screening, diagnosis and monitoring strategies of chronic&#10;      liver disease severity.&#10;&#10;      Our team has the expertise to investigate ultrasound-based and magnetic resonance-based&#10;      elastographic methods for the noninvasive staging of liver fibrosis.&#10;&#10;      The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to compare the sensitivity of&#10;      elastographic methods for detecting histology-determined significant fibrosis.&#10;&#10;      The secondary objectives are to compare the diagnostic accuracy of these elastographic&#10;      methods and the influence of potential confounders (inflammation, steatosis and iron&#10;      deposition) on their diagnostic accuracy."

    briefsummary "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver dysfunction&#10;      worldwide. NAFLD may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and in turn to&#10;      cirrhosis. To date, the detailed pathogenic mechanism of NAFLD including steatosis and NASH&#10;      is not fully characterized, although it is regarded as a hepatic manifestation of the&#10;      metabolic syndrome, sometimes it occurs in the absence of a metabolic syndrome. Based on&#10;      conventional models of &#34;two-hit&#34; and &#34;multi- hit&#34; hypothesis of NAFLD, the dysregulated&#10;      lipid metabolism and insulin resistance are considered as the &#34;first hit&#34; of the liver and&#10;      the following &#34;second hit&#34; or &#34;multi-hit&#34; likely involves oxidative stress, lipid&#10;      peroxidation, increased inflammatory responses, induced hepatic fibrosis and apoptosis. This&#10;      emphasizes the multi-factorial pathogenesis of NAFLD and the necessity to treat NAFLD with&#10;      diabetes-like and multimodal strategy. Several changes in dietary intake have occurred in&#10;      the past few years, including increased energy intake (24%), and increases in added sugars,&#10;      flour and cereal products, fruit, added fats and total fat intake. The increasing prevalence&#10;      of NAFLD is probably directly affected by the contemporary epidemics of obesity, unhealthy&#10;      dietary pattern, and sedentary lifestyle. Currently, there are two major categories of NAFLD&#10;      therapy: lifestyle interventions and pharmaceutical therapies, lifestyle interventions in&#10;      terms of diet and physical activity are regarded as safe and effective, while pharmaceutical&#10;      interventions showed limited efficacy with unknown safety in the long term ,therefore, the&#10;      first line of treatment is lifestyle modification. Although lifestyle intervention dose&#10;      positively affects NAFLD, it has limitations. Patients adherence to dietary intervention is&#10;      50%, while those who do adhere, find it difficult to maintain after 12 months. ).&#10;      Mediterranean diet has been shown to be effective in reducing NAFLD, liver steatosis and&#10;      improve insulin sensitivity. Acupuncture has been found as an effective treatment for&#10;      improving quality of life in various medical conditions , including hepatitis . Acupuncture&#10;      combined with life style intervention has been found effective in the treatment of obesity,&#10;      metabolic syndrome in terms of weight, lipid regulation, glucose levels and various markers&#10;      of inflammation. Acupuncture's effect on NAFLD has yet to be studied.&#10;&#10;      We suggest that acupuncture combined with life style intervention can be an effective&#10;      treatment for NAFLD."
