## Introduction
OpenTrials is a collaboration between Open Knowledge and Dr Ben Goldacre
from the University of Oxford DataLab. It aims to locate, match, and 
share all publicly accessible data and documents, on all trials 
conducted, on all medicines and other treatments, globally.

OpenTrials is building a collaborative and open linked database for all 
available structured data and documents on all clinical trials, 
threaded together by individual trial. With a versatile and 
expandable data schema, it is initially designed to host and 
match the following documents and data for each trial:

* registry entries
* links, abstracts, or texts of academic journal papers
* portions of regulatory documents describing individual trials
* structured data on methods and results extracted by systematic reviewers or other
* researchers
* Clinical Study Reports
* additional documents such as blank consent forms, blank case report forms, and protocols

## Data collection
explorer.opentrials.net

Three main ways of data collection
* scraping registries
* donations of structured data 
* crowdsourced document contributions
